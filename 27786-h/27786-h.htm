	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">This</span> is the story of Doggie Trevor. It tells of
	his doings and of a girl in England and a girl
	in France. Chiefly it is concerned with the influences
	that enabled him to win through the war. Doggie
	Trevor did not get the Victoria Cross. He got no
	cross or distinction whatever. He did not even attain
	the sorrowful glory of a little white cross above his
	grave on the Western Front. Doggie was no hero of
	romance, ancient or modern. But he went through
	with it and is alive to tell the tale.</p>

	<p>The brutal of his acquaintance gave him the name
	of “Doggie” years before the war was ever thought
	of, because he had been brought up from babyhood
	like a toy Pom. The almost freak offspring of elderly
	parents, he had the rough world against him from
	birth. His father died before he had cut a tooth.
	His mother was old enough to be his grandmother.
	She had the intense maternal instinct and the brain,
	such as it is, of an earwig. She wrapped Doggie—his
	real name was James Marmaduke—in cotton-wool,
	and kept him so until he was almost a grown
	man. Doggie had never a chance. She brought him
	up like a toy Pom until he was twenty-one—and then
	she died. Doggie being comfortably off, continued
	the maternal tradition and kept on bringing himself
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>up like a toy Pom. He did not know what else to
	do. Then, when he was five-and-twenty, he found
	himself at the edge of the world gazing in timorous
	starkness down into the abyss of the Great War.
	Something kicked him over the brink and sent him
	sprawling into the thick of it.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">That the world knows little of its greatest men
	is a commonplace among silly aphorisms. With far
	more justice it may be stated that of its least men the
	world knows nothing and cares less. Yet the Doggies
	of the War, who on the cry of “Havoc!” have been
	let loose, much to their own and everybody else’s
	stupefaction, deserve the passing tribute sometimes,
	poor fellows, of a sigh, sometimes of a smile, often
	of a cheer. Very few of them—very few, at any
	rate, of the English Doggies—have tucked their little
	tails between their legs and run away. Once a brawny
	humorist wrote to Doggie Trevor “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sursum cauda.</em>”
	Doggie happened to be at the time in a water-logged
	front trench in Flanders and the writer basking in the
	mild sunshine of Simla with his Territorial regiment.
	Doggie, bidden by the Hedonist of circumstance to
	up with his tail, felt like a scorpion.</p>

	<p>Such feelings, however, will be more adequately
	dealt with hereafter. For the moment, it is only
	essential to obtain a general view of the type to which
	Trevor belonged.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">If there is one spot in England where the present
	is the past, where the future is still more of the past,
	where the past wraps you and enfolds you in the
	dreamy mist of Gothic beauty, where the lazy meadows
	sloping riverward deny the passage of the centuries,
	where the very clouds are secular, it is the cathedral
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>town of Durdlebury. No factory chimneys defile with
	their smoke its calm air, or defy its august and heaven-searching
	spires. No rabble of factory hands shocks
	its few and sedate streets. Divine Providence, according
	to the devout, and the crass stupidity of the local
	authorities seventy years ago, according to progressive
	minds, turned the main line of railway twenty miles
	from the sacred spot. So that to this year of grace it
	is the very devil of a business to find out, from Bradshaw,
	how to get to Durdlebury, and, having found,
	to get there. As for getting away, God help you!
	But whoever wanted to get away from Durdlebury,
	except the Bishop? In pre-motor days he used to
	grumble tremendously and threaten the House of
	Lords with Railway Bills and try to blackmail the
	Government with dark hints of resignation, and so he
	lived and threatened and made his wearisome diocesan
	round of visits and died. But now he has his episcopal
	motor-car, which has deprived him of his grievances.</p>

	<p>In the Close of Durdlebury, greenswarded, silent,
	sentinelled by immemorial elms that guard the dignified
	Gothic dwellings of the cathedral dignitaries, was
	James Marmaduke Trevor born. His father, a man
	of private fortune, was Canon of Durdlebury. For
	many years he lived in the most commodious canonical
	house in the Close with his sisters Sophia and Sarah.
	In the course of time a new Dean, Dr. Conover,
	was appointed to Durdlebury, and, restless innovator
	that he was, underpinned the North Transept and
	split up Canon Trevor’s home by marrying Sophia.
	Then Sarah, bitten by the madness, committed abrupt
	matrimony with the Rev. Vernon Manningtree, Rector
	of Durdlebury. Canon Trevor, many years older
	than his sisters, remained for some months in bewildered
	loneliness, until one day he found himself standing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>in front of the cathedral altar with Miss Mathilda
	Jessup, while the Bishop pronounced over them words
	diabolically strange yet ecclesiastically familiar. Miss
	Jessup, thus transformed into Mrs. Trevor, was a
	mature and comfortable maiden lady of ample means,
	the only and orphan daughter of a late Bishop of Durdlebury.
	Never had there been such a marrying and
	giving in marriage in the cathedral circle. Children
	were born in Decanal, Rectorial and Canonical homes.
	First a son to the Manningtrees, whom they named
	Oliver. Then a daughter to the Conovers. Then
	a son, named James Marmaduke, after the late Bishop
	Jessup, was born to the Trevors. The profane say
	that Canon Trevor, a profound patristic theologian
	and an enthusiastic palæontologist, couldn’t make head
	or tail of it all, and, unable to decide whether James
	Marmaduke should be attributed to Tertullian or the
	Neolithic period, expired in an agony of dubiety. At
	any rate, the poor man died. The widow, of necessity,
	moved from the Close, in order to make way for the
	new Canon, and betook herself with her babe to
	Denby Hall, the comfortable house on the outskirts of
	the town in which she had dwelt before her marriage.</p>

	<p>The saturated essence of Durdlebury ran in Marmaduke’s
	blood: an honourable essence, a proud essence;
	an essence of all that is statically beautiful and dignified
	in English life; but an essence which, without
	admixture of wilder and more fluid elements, is apt
	to run thick and clog the arteries. Marmaduke was
	coddled from his birth. The Dean, then a breezy,
	energetic man, protested. Sarah Manningtree protested.
	But when the Dean’s eldest born died of
	diphtheria, Mrs. Trevor, in her heart, set down the
	death as a judgment on Sophia for criminal carelessness;
	and when young Oliver Manningtree grew up
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>to be an intolerable young Turk and savage, she looked
	on Marmaduke and, thanking heaven that he was
	not as other boys were, enfolded him more than ever
	beneath her motherly wing. When Oliver went to
	school in the town and tore his clothes, and rolled in
	mud and punched other boys’ heads, Marmaduke
	remained at home under the educational charge of a
	governess. Oliver, lean and lanky and swift-eyed,
	swaggered through the streets unattended from the
	first day they sent him to a neighbouring kindergarten.
	As the months and years of his childish life
	passed, he grew more and more independent and vagabond.
	He swore blood brotherhood with a butcher-boy
	and, unknown to his pious parents, became the
	leader of a ferocious gang of pirates. Marmaduke,
	on the other hand, was never allowed to cross the
	road without feminine escort. Oliver had the profoundest
	contempt for Marmaduke. Being two years
	older, he kicked him whenever he had a chance.
	Marmaduke loathed him. Marmaduke shrank into
	Miss Gunter, the governess’s, skirts whenever he saw
	him. Mrs. Trevor therefore regarded Oliver as the
	youthful incarnation of Beelzebub, and quarrelled
	bitterly with her sister-in-law.</p>

	<p>One day, Oliver, with three or four of his piratical
	friends, met Marmaduke and Miss Gunter and a little
	toy terrier in the High Street. The toy terrier was
	attached by a lead to Miss Gunter on the one side,
	Marmaduke by a hand on the other. Oliver straddled
	rudely across the path.</p>

	<p>“Hallo! Look at thet two little doggies!” he
	cried. He snapped his fingers at the terrier. “Come
	along, Tiny!” The terrier yapped. Oliver grinned
	and turned to Marmaduke. “Come along, Fido,
	dear little doggie.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>“You’re a nasty, rude, horrid boy, and I shall tell
	your mother,” declared Miss Gunter indignantly.</p>

	<p>But Oliver and his pirates laughed with the truculence
	befitting their vocation, and bowing with ironical
	politeness, let their victim depart to the parody of a
	popular song: “Good-bye, Doggie, we shall miss
	you.”</p>

	<p>From that day onwards Marmaduke was known
	as “Doggie” throughout all Durdlebury, save to his
	mother and Miss Gunter. The Dean himself grew
	to think of him as “Doggie.” People to this day
	call him Doggie, without any notion of the origin of
	the name.</p>

	<p>To preserve him from persecution, Mrs. Trevor
	jealously guarded him from association with other boys.
	He neither learned nor played any boyish games. In
	defiance of the doctor, whom she regarded as a member
	of the brutal anti-Marmaduke League, Mrs. Trevor
	proclaimed Marmaduke’s delicacy of constitution. He
	must not go out into the rain, lest he should get damp,
	nor into the hot sunshine, lest he should perspire.
	She kept him like a precious plant in a carefully warmed
	conservatory. Doggie, used to it from birth, looked
	on it as his natural environment. Under feminine
	guidance and tuition he embroidered and painted
	screens and played the piano and the mandolin, and
	read Miss Charlotte Yonge and learned history from
	the late Mrs. Markham. Without doubt his life was
	a happy one. All that he asked for was sequestration
	from Oliver and his associates.</p>

	<p>Now and then the cousins were forced to meet—at
	occasional children’s parties, for instance. A little
	daughter, Peggy, had been born in the Deanery, replacing
	the lost firstborn, and festivals—to which came
	the extreme youth of Durdlebury—were given in her
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>honour. She liked Marmaduke, who was five years
	her senior, because he was gentle and clean and wore
	such beautiful clothes and brushed his hair so nicely;
	whereas she detested Oliver, who, even at an afternoon
	party, looked as if he had just come out of a
	rabbit-hole. Besides, Marmaduke danced beautifully;
	Oliver couldn’t and wouldn’t, disdaining such effeminate
	sports. His great joy was to put out a sly leg
	and send Doggie and his partner sprawling. Once the
	Dean caught him at it, and called him a horrid little
	beast, and threatened him with neck and crop expulsion
	if he ever did it again. Doggie, who had picked
	himself up and listened to the rebuke, said:</p>

	<p>“I’m very glad to hear you talk to him like that,
	Uncle. I think his behaviour is perfectly detestable.”</p>

	<p>The Dean’s lips twitched and he turned away
	abruptly. Oliver glared at Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Oh, my holy aunt!” he whispered hoarsely.
	“Just you wait till I get you alone!”</p>

	<p>Oliver got him alone, an hour later, in a passage,
	having lain in ambush for him, and after a few busy
	moments, contemplated a bruised and bleeding Doggie
	blubbering in a corner.</p>

	<p>“Do you think my behaviour is detestable now?”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” whimpered Doggie.</p>

	<p>“I’ve a good mind to go on licking you until you
	say ‘no,’” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>“You’re a great big bully,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Oliver reflected. He did not like to be called a
	bully. “Look here,” said he, “I’ll stick my right
	arm down inside the back of my trousers and fight
	you with my left.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t want to fight. I can’t fight,” cried
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>Oliver put his hands in his pockets.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>“Will you come and play Kiss-in-the-Ring, then?”
	he asked sarcastically.</p>

	<p>“No,” replied Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Well, don’t say I haven’t made you generous
	offers,” said Oliver, and stalked away.</p>

	<p>It was all very well for the Rev. Vernon Manningtree,
	when discussing this incident with the Dean,
	to dismiss Doggie with a contemptuous shrug and
	call him a little worm without any spirit. The unfortunate
	Doggie remained a human soul with a human
	destiny before him. As to his lack of spirit——</p>

	<p>“Where,” said the Dean, a man of wider sympathies,
	“do you suppose he could get any from? Look at
	his parentage. Look at his upbringing by that idiot
	woman.”</p>

	<p>“If he belonged to me, I’d drown him,” said the
	Rector.</p>

	<p>“If I had my way with Oliver,” said the Dean,
	“I’d skin him alive.”</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid he’s a young devil,” said the Rector,
	not without paternal pride. “But he has the makings
	of a man.”</p>

	<p>“So has Marmaduke,” replied the Dean.</p>

	<p>“Bosh!” said Mr. Manningtree.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">When Oliver went to Rugby, happier days than
	ever dawned for Marmaduke. There were only the
	holidays to fear. But as time went on, the haughty
	contempt of Oliver, the public-school boy, for the
	home-bred Doggie, forbade him to notice the little
	creature’s existence; so that even the holidays lost
	their gloomy menace and became like the normal
	halcyontide. Meanwhile Doggie grew up. When
	he reached the age of fourteen, the Dean, by strenuous
	endeavour, rescued him from the unavailing tuition
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>of Miss Gunter. But school for Marmaduke Mrs.
	Trevor would not hear of. It was brutal of Edward—the
	Dean—to suggest such a thing. Marmaduke—so
	sensitive and delicate—school would kill him.
	It would undo all the results of her unceasing care.
	It would make him coarse and vulgar, like other horrid
	boys. She would sooner see him dead at her feet
	than at a public school. It was true that he ought
	to have the education of a gentleman. She did not
	need Edward to point out her duty. She would
	engage a private tutor.</p>

	<p>“All right. I’ll get you one,” said the Dean.</p>

	<p>The Master of his old college at Cambridge sent
	him an excellent youth, who had just taken his degree—a
	second class in the Classical Tripos—an all-round
	athlete and a gentleman. The first thing he did
	was to take Marmaduke on the lazy river that flowed
	through the Durdlebury meadows, thereby endangering
	his life, woefully blistering his hands, and making
	him ache all over his poor little body. After a quarter
	of an hour’s interview with Mrs. Trevor, the indignant
	young man threw up his post and departed.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Trevor determined to select a tutor herself.
	A scholastic agency sent her a dozen candidates. She
	went to London and interviewed them all. A woman,
	even of the most limited intelligence, invariably knows
	what she wants, and invariably gets it. Mrs. Trevor
	got Phineas McPhail, M.A. Glasgow, B.A. Cambridge
	(Third Class Mathematical Greats), reading for Holy
	Orders.</p>

	<p>“I was training for the ministry in the Free Kirk
	of Scotland,” said he, “when I gradually became aware
	of the error of my ways, and saw that there could only
	be salvation in the episcopal form of Church government.
	As the daughter of a bishop, Mrs. Trevor,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>you will appreciate my conscientious position. An
	open scholarship and the remainder of my little patrimony
	enabled me to get my Oxford degree. You
	would have no objection to my continuing my theological
	studies while I undertake the education of
	your son?”</p>

	<p>Phineas McPhail pleased Mrs. Trevor. He had
	what she called a rugged, honest Scotch face, with a
	very big nose in the middle of it, and little grey eyes
	overhung by brown and shaggy eyebrows. He spoke
	with the mere captivating suggestion of an accent.
	The son of decayed, proud, and now extinct gentlefolk,
	he presented personal testimonials of an unexceptionable
	quality.</p>

	<p>Phineas McPhail took to Doggie and Durdlebury
	as a duck to water. He read for Holy Orders for
	seven years. When the question of his ordination
	arose, he would declare impressively that his sacred
	duty was the making of Marmaduke into a scholar
	and a Christian. That duty accomplished, he would
	begin to think of himself. Mrs. Trevor accounted
	him the most devoted and selfless friend that woman
	ever had. He saw eye to eye with her in every detail
	of Marmaduke’s upbringing. He certainly taught the
	boy, who was naturally intelligent, a great deal, and
	repaired the terrible gaps in Miss Gunter’s system of
	education. McPhail had started life with many eager
	curiosities, under the impulse of which he had amassed
	considerable knowledge of a superficial kind which,
	lolling in an arm-chair, with a pipe in his mouth,
	he found easy to impart. To the credit side of Mrs.
	Trevor’s queer account it may be put that she did not
	object to smoking. The late Canon smoked incessantly.
	Perhaps the odour of tobacco was the only
	keen memory of her honeymoon and brief married life.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>During his seven years of soft living, Phineas McPhail
	scientifically developed an original taste for whisky.
	He seethed himself in it as the ancients seethed a kid
	in its mother’s milk. He had the art to do himself
	to perfection. Mrs. Trevor beheld in him the mellowest
	and blandest of men. Never had she the slightest
	suspicion of evil courses. To such a pitch of cunning
	in the observance of the proprieties had he arrived,
	that the very servants knew not of his doings. It
	was only later—after Mrs. Trevor’s death—when a
	surveyor was called in by Marmaduke to put the old
	house in order, that a disused well at the back of the
	house was found to be half filled with hundreds of
	whisky bottles secretly thrown in by Phineas McPhail.</p>

	<p>The Dean and Mr. Manningtree, although ignorant
	of McPhail’s habits, agreed in calling him a lazy
	hound and a parasite on their fond sister-in-law. And
	they were right. But Mrs. Trevor turned a deaf
	ear to their slanders. They were unworthy to be
	called Christian men, let alone ministers of the Gospel.
	Were it not for the sacred associations of her father
	and her husband, she would never enter the cathedral
	again. Mr. McPhail was exactly the kind of tutor
	that Marmaduke needed. Mr. McPhail did not
	encourage him to play rough games, or take long
	walks, or row on the river, because he appreciated his
	constitutional delicacy. He was the only man in the
	world during her unhappy widowhood who understood
	Marmaduke. He was a treasure beyond price.</p>

	<p>When Doggie was sixteen, fate, fortune, chance, or
	whatever you like to call it, did him a good turn. It
	made his mother ill, and sent him away with her to
	foreign health resorts. Doggie and McPhail travelled
	luxuriously, lived in luxurious hotels and visited in
	luxurious ease various picture galleries and monuments
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>of historic or æsthetic interest. The boy, artistically
	inclined and guided by the idle yet well-informed
	Phineas, profited greatly. Phineas sought profit to
	them both in other ways.</p>

	<p>“Mrs. Trevor,” said he, “don’t you think it a
	sinful shame for Marmaduke to waste his time over
	Latin and mathematics, and such things as he can
	learn at home, instead of taking advantage of his
	residence in a foreign country to perfect himself in
	the idiomatic and conversational use of the language?”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Trevor, as usual, agreed. So thenceforward,
	whenever they were abroad, which was for three or
	four months of each year, Phineas revelled in sheer
	idleness, nicotine, and the skilful consumption of
	alcohol, while highly paid professors taught Marmaduke—and,
	incidentally, himself—French and Italian.</p>

	<p>Of the world, however, and of the facts, grim or
	seductive, of life, Doggie learned little. Whether by
	force of some streak of honesty, whether through
	sheer laziness, whether through canny self-interest,
	Phineas McPhail conspired with Mrs. Trevor to keep
	Doggie in darkest ignorance. His reading was selected
	like that of a young girl in a convent: he was taken
	only to the most innocent of plays: foreign theatres,
	casinos, and such-like wells of delectable depravity,
	existed almost beyond his ken. Until he was twenty
	it never occurred to him to sit up after his mother had
	gone to bed. Of strange goddesses he knew nothing.
	His mother saw to that. He had a mild affection
	for his cousin Peggy, which his mother encouraged.
	She allowed him to smoke cigarettes, drink fine claret,
	the remains of the cellar of her father, the bishop, a
	connoisseur, and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crème de menthe</em>. And, until she
	died, that was all poor Doggie knew of the lustiness
	of life.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>Mrs. Trevor died, and Doggie, as soon as he had
	recovered from the intensity of his grief, looked out
	upon a lonely world. Phineas, like Mrs. Micawber,
	swore he would never desert him. In the perils of
	Polar exploration or the comforts of Denby Hall, he
	would find Phineas McPhail ever by his side. The
	first half-dozen or so of these declarations consoled
	Doggie tremendously. He dreaded the Church
	swallowing up his only protector and leaving him
	defenceless. Conscientiously, however, he said:</p>

	<p>“I don’t want your affection for me to stand in
	your way, sir.”</p>

	<p>“‘Sir’?” cried Phineas, “is it not practicable for
	us to do away with the old relations of master and pupil,
	and become as brothers? You are now a man, and
	independent. Let us be Pylades and Orestes. Let
	us share and share alike. Let us be Marmaduke and
	Phineas.”</p>

	<p>Doggie was touched by such devotion. “But your
	ambitions to take Holy Orders, which you have sacrificed
	for my sake?”</p>

	<p>“I think it may be argued,” said Phineas, “that
	the really beautiful life is delight in continued sacrifice.
	Besides, my dear boy, I am not quite so sure
	as I was when I was young, that by confining
	oneself within the narrow limits of a sacerdotal
	profession, one can retain all one’s wider sympathies
	both with human infirmity and the gladder things of
	existence.”</p>

	<p>“You’re a true friend, Phineas,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“I am,” replied Phineas.</p>

	<p>It was just after this that Doggie wrote him a
	cheque for a thousand pounds on account of a vaguely
	indicated year’s salary.</p>

	<p>If Phineas had maintained the wily caution which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>he had exercised for the past seven years, all might
	have been well. But there came a time when unneedfully
	he declared once more that he would never
	desert Marmaduke, and declaring it, hiccoughed so
	horribly and stared so glassily, that Doggie feared he
	might be ill. He had just lurched into Doggie’s own
	peacock-blue and ivory sitting-room when he was
	mournfully playing the piano.</p>

	<p>“You’re unwell, Phineas. Let me get you something.”</p>

	<p>“You’re right, laddie,” Phineas agreed, his legs
	giving way alarmingly, so that he collapsed on a
	brocade-covered couch. “It’s a touch of the sun,
	which I would give you to understand,” he continued
	with a self-preservatory flash, for it was an overcast
	day in June, “is often magnified in power when it
	is behind a cloud. A wee drop of whisky is what I
	require for a complete recovery.”</p>

	<p>Doggie ran into the dining-room and returned with
	a decanter of whisky, glass and siphon—an adjunct
	to the sideboard since Mrs. Trevor’s death. Phineas
	filled half the tumbler with spirit, tossed it off, smiled
	fantastically, tried to rise, and rolled upon the carpet.
	Doggie, frightened, rang the bell. Peddle, the old
	butler, appeared.</p>

	<p>“Mr. McPhail is ill. I can’t think what can be
	the matter with him.”</p>

	<p>Peddle looked at the happy Phineas with the eyes
	of experience.</p>

	<p>“If you will allow me to say so, sir,” said he, “the
	gentleman is dead drunk.”</p>

	<p>And that was the beginning of the end of Phineas.
	He lost grip of himself. He became the scarlet scandal
	of Durdlebury and the terror of Doggie’s life. The
	Dean came to the rescue of a grateful nephew. A
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>swift attack of delirium tremens crowned and ended
	Phineas McPhail’s Durdlebury career.</p>

	<p>“My boy,” said the Dean on the day of Phineas’s
	expulsion, “I don’t want to rub it in unduly, but I’ve
	warned your poor mother for years, and you for months,
	against this bone-idle, worthless fellow. Neither of
	you would listen to me. But you see that I was right.
	Perhaps now you may be more inclined to take my
	advice.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, Uncle,” replied Doggie submissively.</p>

	<p>The Dean, a comfortable florid man in the early
	sixties, took up his parable and expounded it for three-quarters
	of an hour. If ever young man heard that
	which was earnestly meant for his welfare, Doggie
	heard it from his Very Reverend Uncle’s lips.</p>

	<p>“And now, my dear boy,” said the Dean by way
	of peroration, “you cannot but understand that it is
	your bounden duty to apply yourself to some serious
	purpose in life.”</p>

	<p>“I do,” said Doggie. “I’ve been thinking over
	it for a long time. I’m going to gather material for
	a history of wall-papers.”</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_II"><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER II</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Thenceforward</span> Doggie, like the late Mr.
	Matthew Arnold’s fellow-millions, lived alone.
	He did not complain. There was little to complain
	about. He owned a pleasant old house set in fifteen
	acres of grounds. He had an income of three thousand
	pounds a year. Old Peddle, the butler, and his wife,
	the housekeeper, saved him from domestic cares.
	Rising late and retiring early, like the good King of
	Yvetot, he cheated the hours that might have proved
	weary. His meals, his toilet, his music, his wall-papers,
	his drawing and embroidering—specimens of the last
	he exhibited with great success at various shows held
	by Arts and Crafts Guilds, and such-like high and
	artistic fellowships—his sweet-peas, his chrysanthemums,
	his postage stamps, his dilettante reading and
	his mild social engagements, filled most satisfyingly
	the hours not claimed by slumber. Now and then
	appointments with his tailor summoned him to London.
	He stayed at the same mildewed old family hotel in
	the neighbourhood of Bond Street at which his mother
	and his grandfather, the bishop, had stayed for uncountable
	years. There he would lunch and dine
	stodgily in musty state. In the evenings he would
	go to the plays discussed in the less giddy of Durdlebury
	ecclesiastical circles. The play over, it never
	occurred to him to do otherwise than drive decorously
	back to Sturrocks’s Hotel. Suppers at the Carlton
	or the Savoy were outside his sphere of thought or
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>opportunity. His only acquaintance in London were
	vague elderly female friends of his mother, who invited
	him to chilly semi-suburban teas and entertained him
	with tepid reminiscence and criticism of their divers
	places of worship. The days in London thus passed
	drearily, and Doggie was always glad to get home
	again.</p>

	<p>In Durdlebury he began to feel himself appreciated.
	The sleepy society of the place accepted him as a young
	man of unquestionable birth and irreproachable morals.
	He could play the piano, the harp, the viola, the flute,
	and the clarinet, and sing a very true mild tenor. As
	secretary of the Durdlebury Musical Association, he
	filled an important position in the town. Dr. Flint—Joshua
	Flint, Mus. Doc.—organist of the cathedral,
	scattered broadcast golden opinions of Doggie. There
	was once a concert of old English music, which the
	dramatic critics of the great newspapers attended—and
	one of them mentioned Doggie—“Mr. Marmaduke
	Trevor, who played the viol da gamba as to the manner
	born.” Doggie cut out the notice, framed it, and
	stuck it up in his peacock and ivory sitting-room.</p>

	<p>Besides music, Doggie had other social accomplishments.
	He could dance. He could escort young
	ladies home of nights. Not a dragon in Durdlebury
	would not have trusted Doggie with untold daughters.
	With women, old and young, he had no shynesses. He
	had been bred among them, understood their purely
	feminine interests, and instinctively took their point of
	view. On his visits to London, he could be entrusted
	with commissions. He could choose the exact shade
	of silk for a drawing-room sofa cushion, and had an
	unerring taste in the selection of wedding presents.
	Young men, other than budding ecclesiastical dignitaries,
	were rare in Durdlebury, and Doggie had little to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>fear from the competition of coarser masculine natures.
	In a word, Doggie was popular.</p>

	<p>Although of no mean or revengeful nature, he
	was human enough to feel a little malicious satisfaction
	when it was proved to Durdlebury that Oliver had
	gone to the devil. His Aunt Sarah, Mrs. Manningtree,
	had died midway in the Phineas McPhail period;
	Mr. Manningtree a year or so later had accepted a
	living in the North of England, and died when Doggie
	was about four-and-twenty. Meanwhile Oliver, who
	had been withdrawn young from Rugby, where he
	had been a thorn in the side of the authorities, and
	had been pinned like a cockchafer to a desk in a family
	counting-house in Lothbury, E.C., had broken loose,
	quarrelled with his father, gone off with paternal
	malediction and a maternal heritage of a thousand
	pounds to California, and was lost to the family ken.
	When a man does not write to his family, what explanation
	can there be save that he is ashamed to do so?
	Oliver was ashamed of himself. He had taken to
	desperate courses. He was an outlaw. He had gone
	to the devil. His name was rarely mentioned in
	Durdlebury—to Marmaduke Trevor’s very great and
	catlike satisfaction. Only to the Dean’s ripe and
	kindly wisdom was his name not utterly anathema.</p>

	<p>“My dear,” said he once to his wife, who was
	deploring her nephew’s character and fate—“I have
	hopes of Oliver even yet. A man must have something
	of the devil in him if he wants to drive the devil out.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Conover was shocked. “My dear Edward!”
	she cried.</p>

	<p>“My dear Sophia,” said he, with a twinkle in his
	mild blue eyes that had puzzled her from the day
	when he first put a decorous arm round her waist.
	“My dear Sophia, if you knew what a ding-dong scrap
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>of fiends went on inside me before I could bring myself
	to vow to be a virtuous milk-and-water parson, your
	hair, which is as long and beautiful as ever, would
	stand up straight on end.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Conover sighed.</p>

	<p>“I give you up.”</p>

	<p>“It’s too late,” said the Dean.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Manningtrees, father and mother and son,
	were gone. Doggie bore the triple loss with equanimity.
	Then Peggy Conover, hitherto under the
	eclipse of boarding-schools, finishing schools and foreign
	travel, swam, at the age of twenty, within his orbit.
	When first they met, after a year’s absence, she very
	gracefully withered the symptoms of the cousinly kiss,
	to which they had been accustomed all their lives,
	by stretching out a long, frank, and defensive arm.
	Perhaps if she had allowed the salute, there would have
	been an end of the matter. But there came the
	phenomenon which, unless she was a minx of craft
	and subtlety, she did not anticipate; for the first
	time in his life he was possessed of a crazy desire to
	kiss her. Doggie fell in love. It was not a wild
	consuming passion. He slept well, he ate well, and
	he played the flute without a sigh causing him to
	blow discordantly into the holes of the instrument.
	Peggy vowing that she would not marry a parson, he
	had no rivals. He knew not even the pinpricks of
	jealousy. Peggy liked him. At first she delighted
	in him as in a new and animated toy. She could pull
	strings and the figure worked amazingly and amusingly.
	He proved himself to be a useful toy, too.
	He was at her beck all day long. He ran on errands,
	he fetched and carried. Peggy realized blissfully that
	she owned him. He haunted the Deanery.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>One evening after dinner the Dean said:</p>

	<p>“I am going to play the heavy father. How are
	things between you and Peggy?”</p>

	<p>Marmaduke, taken unawares, reddened violently.
	He murmured that he didn’t know.</p>

	<p>“You ought to,” said the Dean. “When a young
	man converts himself into a girl’s shadow, even although
	he is her cousin and has been brought up with
	her from childhood, people begin to gossip. They
	gossip even within the august precincts of a stately
	cathedral.”</p>

	<p>“I’m very sorry,” said Marmaduke. “I’ve had
	the very best intentions.”</p>

	<p>The Dean smiled.</p>

	<p>“What were they?”</p>

	<p>“To make her like me a little,” replied Marmaduke.
	Then, feeling that the Dean was kindly disposed, he
	blurted out awkwardly: “I hoped that one day I
	might ask her to marry me.”</p>

	<p>“That’s what I wanted to know,” said the Dean.</p>

	<p>“You haven’t done it yet?”</p>

	<p>“No,” said Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

	<p>“It seems taking such a liberty,” replied Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>The Dean laughed. “Well, I’m not going to do
	it for you. My chief desire is to regularize the present
	situation. I can’t have you two running about together
	all day and every day. If you like to ask
	Peggy, you have my permission and her mother’s.”</p>

	<p>“Thank you, Uncle Edward,” said Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“Let us join the ladies,” said the Dean.</p>

	<p>In the drawing-room the Dean exchanged glances
	with his wife. She saw that he had done as he had
	been bidden. Marmaduke was not an ideal husband
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>for a brisk, pleasure-loving modern young woman.
	But where was another husband to come from?
	Peggy had banned the Church. Marmaduke was
	wealthy, sound in health and free from vice. It was
	obvious to maternal eyes that he was in love with
	Peggy. According to the Dean, if he wasn’t, he
	oughtn’t to be for ever at her heels. The young
	woman herself seemed to take considerable pleasure
	in his company. If she cared nothing for him, she
	was acting in a reprehensible manner. So the Dean
	had been deputed to sound Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>Half an hour later the young people were left alone.
	First the Dean went to his study. Then Mrs. Conover
	departed to write letters. Marmaduke advancing
	across the room from the door which he had opened,
	met Peggy’s mocking eyes as she stood on the hearthrug
	with her hands behind her back. Doggie felt
	very uncomfortable. Never had he said a word to
	her in betrayal of his feelings. He had a vague idea
	that propriety required a young man to get through
	some wooing before asking a girl to marry him. To
	ask first and woo afterwards seemed putting the cart
	before the horse. But how to woo that remarkably
	cool and collected young person standing there, passed
	his wit.</p>

	<p>“Well,” she said, “the dear old birds seem very
	fussy to-night. What’s the matter?” And as he
	said nothing, but stood confused with his hands in his
	pockets, she went on. “You, too, seem rather ruffled.
	Look at your hair.”</p>

	<p>Doggie, turning to a mirror, perceived that an
	agitated hand had disturbed the symmetry of his sleek
	black hair, brushed without a parting away from the
	forehead over his head. Hastily he smoothed down
	the cockatoo-like crest.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>“I’ve been talking to your father, Peggy.”</p>

	<p>“Have you really?” she said with a laugh.</p>

	<p>Marmaduke summoned his courage.</p>

	<p>“He told me I might ask you to marry me,” he
	said.</p>

	<p>“Do you want to?”</p>

	<p>“Of course I do,” he declared.</p>

	<p>“Then why not do it?”</p>

	<p>But before he could answer, she clapped her hands
	on his shoulders, and shook him, and laughed out loud.</p>

	<p>“Oh, you dear silly old thing! What a way to
	propose to a girl!”</p>

	<p>“I’ve never done such a thing before,” said Doggie,
	as soon as he was released.</p>

	<p>She resumed her attitude on the hearthrug.</p>

	<p>“I’m in no great hurry to be married. Are you?”</p>

	<p>He said: “I don’t know. I’ve never thought of
	it. Just whenever you like.”</p>

	<p>“All right,” she returned calmly. “Let it be a
	year hence. Meanwhile, we can be engaged. It’ll
	please the dear old birds. I know all the tabbies in
	the town have been mewing about us. Now they
	can mew about somebody else.”</p>

	<p>“That’s awfully good of you, Peggy,” said Marmaduke.
	“I’ll go up to town to-morrow and get you
	the jolliest ring you ever saw.”</p>

	<p>She sketched him a curtsy. “That’s one thing,
	at any rate, I can trust you in—your taste in jewellery.”</p>

	<p>He moved nearer to her. “I suppose you know,
	Peggy dear, I’ve been awfully fond of you for quite a
	long time.”</p>

	<p>“The feeling is more or less reciprocated,” she
	replied lightly. Then, “You can kiss me if you
	like. I assure you it’s quite usual.”</p>

	<p>He kissed her somewhat shyly on the lips.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>She whispered: “I do think I care for you, old
	thing.” Marmaduke replied sententiously: “You
	have made me a very happy man.” Then they sat
	down side by side on the sofa, and for all Peggy’s
	mocking audacity, they could find nothing in particular
	to say to each other.</p>

	<p>“Let us play patience,” she said at last.</p>

	<p>And when Mrs. Conover appeared awhile later,
	she found them poring over the cards in a state of
	unruffled calm. Peggy looked up, smiled, and nodded.</p>

	<p>“We’ve fixed it up, Mummy; but we’re not
	going to be married for a year.”</p>

	<p>Doggie went home that evening in a tepid glow.
	It contented him. He thought himself the luckiest
	of mortals. A young man with more passion or
	imagination might have deplored the lack of romance
	in the betrothal. He might have desired on the part
	of the maiden either more shyness, delicacy, and elusiveness,
	or more resonant emotion. The finer tendrils
	of his being might have shivered, ready to shrivel, as
	at a touch of frost, in the cool ironical atmosphere
	which the girl had created around her. But Doggie
	was not such a young man. Such passions as heredity
	had endowed him with had been drugged by training.
	No tales of immortal love had ever fired his blood.
	Once, somewhere abroad, the unprincipled McPhail
	found him reading <em>Manon Lescaut</em>—he had bought
	a cheap copy haphazard—and taking the delectable
	volume out of his hands, asked him what he thought
	of it.</p>

	<p>“It’s like reading about a lunatic,” replied the
	bewildered Doggie. “Do such people as Des Grieux
	exist?”</p>

	<p>“Ay, laddie,” replied McPhail, greatly relieved.
	“Your acumen has pierced to the root of the matter.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>They do exist, but nowadays we put them into asylums.
	We must excuse the author for living in the psychological
	obscurity of the eighteenth century. It’s just
	a silly, rotten book.”</p>

	<p>“I’m glad you’re of the same opinion as myself,”
	said Doggie, and thought no more of the absurd but
	deathless pair of lovers. The unprincipled McPhail,
	not without pawky humour, immediately gave him
	<em>Paul et Virginie</em>, which Doggie, after reading it,
	thought the truest and most beautiful story in the
	world. Even in later years, when his intelligence
	had ripened and his sphere of reading expanded, he
	looked upon the passion of a Romeo or an Othello
	as a conventional peg on which the poet hung his
	imagery, but having no more relation to real life as
	it is lived by human beings than the blood-lust of the
	half-man, half-bull Minotaur, or the uncomfortable
	riding conversation of the Valkyrie.</p>

	<p>So Doggie Trevor went home perfectly contented
	with himself, with Peggy Conover, with his Uncle
	and Aunt, of whom hitherto he had been just a little
	bit afraid, with Fortune, with Fate, with his house,
	with his peacock and ivory room, with a great clump
	of typescript and a mass of coloured proof-prints,
	which represented a third of his projected history of
	wall-papers, with his feather-bed, with Goliath, his
	almost microscopic Belgian griffon, with a set of
	Nile-green silk underwear that had just come from
	his outfitters in London, with his new Rolls-Royce
	car and his new chauffeur Briggins (parenthetically
	it may be remarked that a seven-hour excursion in
	this vehicle, youth in the back seat and Briggins at the
	helm, all ordained by Peggy, had been the final cause
	of the evening’s explanations), with the starry heavens
	above, with the well-ordered earth beneath them,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>and with all human beings on the earth, including
	Germans, Turks, Infidels, and Hereticks—all save
	one: and that, as he learned from a letter delivered
	by the last post, was a callous, heartless London manicurist
	who, giving no reasons, regretted that she would
	be unable to pay her usual weekly visit to Durdlebury
	on the morrow. Of all days in the year: just when it
	was essential that he should look his best!</p>

	<p>“What the deuce am I going to do?” he cried,
	pitching the letter into the waste-paper basket.</p>

	<p>He sat down to the piano in the peacock and ivory
	room and tried to play the nasty crumpled rose-leaf
	of a manicurist out of his mind.</p>

	<p>Suddenly he remembered, with a kind of shock,
	that he had pledged himself to go up to London the
	next day to buy an engagement-ring. So after all
	the manicurist’s defection did not matter. All was
	again well with the world.</p>

	<p>Then he went to bed and slept the sleep of the just
	and perfect man living the just and perfect life in a
	just and perfect universe.</p>

	<p>And the date of this happening was the fifteenth
	day of July in the year of grace one thousand nine
	hundred and fourteen.</p>

	slanted over the end of the Deanery
	garden, leaving the house in the blaze of the afternoon
	sun, and divided the old red-brick wall into a vivid
	contrast of tones. The peace of centuries brooded
	over the place. No outside convulsions could ever
	cause a flutter of her calm wings. As it was thirty
	years ago, when the Dean first came to Durdlebury,
	as it was three hundred, six hundred years ago, so it
	was now; and so it would be hundreds of years
	hence as long as that majestic pile housing the Spirit
	of God should last.</p>

	<p>Thus thought, thus, in some such words, proclaimed
	the Dean, sitting in the shade, with his hands clasped
	behind his head. Tea was over. Mrs. Conover,
	thin and faded, still sat by the little table, wondering
	whether she might now blow out the lamp beneath
	the silver kettle. Sir Archibald Bruce, a neighbouring
	landowner, and his wife had come, bringing their
	daughter Dorothy to play tennis. The game had
	already started on the court some little distance off—the
	players being Dorothy, Peggy and a couple of
	athletic, flannel-clad parsons. Marmaduke Trevor
	reposed on a chair under the lee of Lady Bruce.
	He looked very cool and spick and span in a grey
	cashmere suit, grey shirt, socks and tie, and grey
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suède</em> shoes. He had a weak, good-looking little
	face and a little black moustache turned up at the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>ends. He was discoursing to his neighbour on
	Palestrina.</p>

	<p>The Dean’s proclamation had been elicited by some
	remark of Sir Archibald.</p>

	<p>“I wonder how you have stuck it for so long,”
	said the latter. He had been a soldier in his youth
	and an explorer, and had shot big game.</p>

	<p>“I haven’t your genius, my dear Bruce, for making
	myself uncomfortable,” replied the Dean.</p>

	<p>“You were energetic enough when you first came
	here,” said Sir Archibald. “We all thought you a
	desperate fellow who was going to rebuild the cathedral,
	turn the Close into industrial dwellings, and
	generally play the deuce.”</p>

	<p>The Dean sighed pleasantly. He had snowy
	hair and a genial, florid, clean-shaven face.</p>

	<p>“I was appointed very young—six-and-thirty—and
	I thought I could fight against the centuries.
	As the years went on I found I couldn’t. The
	grey changelessness of things got hold of me, incorporated
	me into them. When I die—for I hope
	I shan’t have to resign through doddering senility—my
	body will be buried there”—he jerked his head
	slightly towards the cathedral—“and my dust will
	become part and parcel of the fabric—like that of many
	of my predecessors.”</p>

	<p>“That’s all very well,” said Sir Archibald, “but
	they ought to have caught you before this petrification
	set in, and made you a bishop.”</p>

	<p>It was somewhat of an old argument, for the two
	were intimates. The Dean smiled and shook his head.</p>

	<p>“You know I declined——”</p>

	<p>“After you had become petrified.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps so. It is not a place where ambitions
	can attain a riotous growth.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>“I call it a rotten place,” said the elderly worldling.
	“I wouldn’t live in it myself for twenty thousand a year.”</p>

	<p>“Lots like you said the same in crusading times—Sir
	Guy de Chevenix, for instance, who was the
	Lord, perhaps, of your very Manor, and an amazing
	fire-eater—but—see the gentle irony of it—there his
	bones lie, at peace for ever, in the rotten place, with
	his effigy over them cross-legged and his dog at his
	feet, and his wife by his side. I think he must sometimes
	look out of Heaven’s gate down on the cathedral
	and feel glad, grateful—perhaps a bit wistful—if the
	attribution of wistfulness, which implies regret, to a
	spirit in Paradise doesn’t savour of heresy——”</p>

	<p>“I’m going to be cremated,” interrupted Sir
	Archibald, twirling his white moustache.</p>

	<p>The Dean smiled and did not take up the cue.
	The talk died. It was a drowsy day. The Dean
	went off into a little reverie. Perhaps his old friend’s
	reproach was just. Dean of a great cathedral at
	thirty-six, he had the world of dioceses at his feet.
	Had he used to the full the brilliant talents with
	which he started? He had been a good Dean,
	a capable, business-like Dean. There was not a
	stone of the cathedral that he did not know and cherish.
	Under his care the stability of every part of the precious
	fabric had been assured for a hundred years. Its
	financial position, desperate on his appointment,
	was now sound. He had come into a scene of petty
	discords and jealousies; for many years there had
	been a no more united chapter in any cathedral close
	in England. As an administrator he had been a
	success. The devotion of his life to the cathedral
	had its roots deep in spiritual things. For the greater
	glory of God had the vast edifice been erected, and
	for the greater glory of God had he, its guardian,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>reverently seen to its preservation and perfect appointment.
	Would he have served God better by pursuing
	the ambitions of youth? He could have had his
	bishopric; but he knew that the choice lay between
	him and Chanways, a flaming spirit, eager for power,
	who hadn’t the sacred charge of a cathedral, and he
	declined. And now Chanways was a force in the
	Church and the country, and was making things hum.
	If he, Conover, after fifteen years of Durdlebury,
	had accepted, he would have lost the power to make
	things hum. He would have made a very ordinary,
	painstaking bishop, and his successor at Durdlebury
	might possibly have regarded that time-worn wonder
	of spiritual beauty merely as a stepping-stone to higher
	sacerdotal things. Such a man, he considered, having
	once come under the holy glamour of the cathedral,
	would have been guilty of the Unforgivable Sin.
	He had therefore saved two unfortunate situations.</p>

	<p>“You are quite an intelligent man, Bruce,” he
	said, with a sudden whimsicality, “but I don’t think
	you would ever understand.”</p>

	<p>The set of tennis being over, Peggy, flushed and
	triumphant, rushed into the party in the shade.</p>

	<p>“Mr. Petherbridge and I have won—six—three,”
	she announced. The old gentlemen smiled and
	murmured their congratulations. She swung to
	the tea-table some paces away, and plucked Marmaduke
	by the sleeve, interrupting him in the middle
	of an argument. He rose politely.</p>

	<p>“Come and play.”</p>

	<p>“My dear,” he said, “I’m such a duffer at games.”</p>

	<p>“Never mind; you’ll learn in time.”</p>

	<p>He drew out a grey silk handkerchief as if ready
	to perspire at the first thought of it. “Tennis makes
	one so dreadfully hot,” said he.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>Peggy tapped the point of her foot irritably, but
	she laughed as she turned to Lady Bruce.</p>

	<p>“What’s the good of being engaged to a man if
	he can’t play tennis with you?”</p>

	<p>“There are other things in life besides tennis,
	my dear,” replied Lady Bruce.</p>

	<p>The girl flushed, but being aware that a pert answer
	turneth away pleasant invitations, said nothing. She
	nodded and went off to her game, and informing Mr.
	Petherbridge that Lady Bruce was a platitudinous
	old tabby, flirted with him up to the nice limits of
	his parsonical dignity. But Marmaduke did not mind.</p>

	<p>“Games are childish and somewhat barbaric.
	Don’t you think so, Lady Bruce?”</p>

	<p>“Most young people seem fond of them,” replied
	the lady. “Exercise keeps them in health.”</p>

	<p>“It all depends,” he argued. “Often they get
	exceedingly hot, then they sit about and catch their
	death of cold.”</p>

	<p>“That’s very true,” said Lady Bruce. “It’s
	what I’m always telling Sir Archibald about golf.
	Only last week he caught a severe chill in that very
	way. I had to rub his chest with camphorated oil.”</p>

	<p>“Just as my poor dear mother used to do to me,”
	said Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>There followed a conversation on ailments and
	their treatment, in which Mrs. Conover joined.
	Marmaduke was quite happy. He knew that the
	two elderly ladies admired the soundness of his views
	and talked to him as to one of themselves.</p>

	<p>“I’m sure, my dear Marmaduke, you’re very wise
	to take care of yourself,” said Lady Bruce, “especially
	now, when you have the responsibilities of married
	life before you.”</p>

	<p>Marmaduke curled himself up comfortably in his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>chair. If he had been a cat, he would have purred.
	The old butler, grown as grey in the service of the
	Deanery as the cathedral itself—he had been page
	and footman to Dr. Conover’s predecessor—removed
	the tea-things and brought out a tray of glasses and
	lemonade with ice clinking refreshingly against the
	sides of the jug. When the game was over, the players
	came and drank and sat about the lawn. The shadow
	of the apse had spread over the garden to the steps
	of the porch. Anyone looking over the garden wall
	would have beheld a scene typical of the heart of
	England—a scene of peace, ease and perfectly ordered
	comfort. The two well-built young men, one a
	minor canon, the other a curate, lounging in their
	flannels, clever-faced, honest-eyed, could have been
	bred nowhere but in English public schools and at
	Oxford or Cambridge. The two elderly ladies were
	of the fine flower of provincial England; the two old
	men, so different outwardly, one burly, florid, exquisitely
	ecclesiastical, the other thin, nervous, soldierly,
	each was an expression of high English tradition.
	The two young girls, unerringly correct and dainty,
	for all their modern abandonment of attitude, pretty,
	flushed of cheek, frank of glance, were two of a
	hundred thousand flowers of girlhood that could have
	been picked that afternoon in lazy English gardens.
	And Marmaduke’s impeccable grey costume struck a
	harmonizing English note of Bond Street and the
	Burlington Arcade. The scent of the roses massed in
	delicate splendour against the wall, and breathing now
	that the cool shade had fallen on them, crept through
	the still air to the flying buttresses and the window
	mullions and traceries and the pinnacles of the great
	English cathedral. And in the midst of the shaven
	lawn gleamed the old cut-glass jug on its silver tray.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>Some one did look over the wall and survey the
	scene: a man, apparently supporting himself with
	tense, straightened arms on the coping; a man with
	a lean, bronzed, clean-shaven face, wearing an old
	soft felt hat at a swaggering angle; a man with a smile
	on his face and a humorous twinkle in his eyes. By
	chance he had leisure to survey the scene for some time
	unobserved. At last he shouted:</p>

	<p>“Hello! Have none of you ever moved for the
	last ten years?”</p>

	<p>At the summons every one was startled. The
	young men scrambled to their feet. The Dean rose
	and glared at the intruder, who sprang over the wall,
	recklessly broke through the rose-bushes and advanced
	with outstretched hand to meet him.</p>

	<p>“Hello, Uncle Edward!”</p>

	<p>“Goodness gracious me!” cried the Dean. “It’s
	Oliver!”</p>

	<p>“Right first time,” said the young man, gripping
	him by the hand. “You’re not looking a day older.
	And Aunt Sophia——” He strode up to Mrs. Conover
	and kissed her. “Do you know,” he went on,
	holding her at arm’s length and looking round at
	the astonished company, “the last time I saw you
	all you were doing just the same! I peeped over the
	wall just before I went away, just such a summer
	afternoon as this, and you were all sitting round
	drinking the same old lemonade out of the same
	old jug—and, Lady Bruce, you were here, and you,
	Sir Archibald”—he shook hands with them rapidly.
	“You haven’t changed a bit. And you—good Lord!
	Is this Peggy?” He put his hand on the Dean’s
	shoulder and pointed at the girl.</p>

	<p>“That’s Peggy,” said the Dean.</p>

	<p>“You’re the only thing that’s grown. I used to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>gallop with you on my shoulders all round the lawn.
	I suppose you remember? How do you do?”</p>

	<p>And without waiting for an answer he kissed her
	soundly. It was all done with whirlwind suddenness.
	The tempestuous young man had scattered every one’s
	wits. All stared at him. Releasing Peggy——</p>

	<p>“My holy aunt!” he cried, “there’s another of
	’em. It’s Doggie! You were in the old picture,
	and I’m blessed if you weren’t wearing the same
	beautiful grey suit. How do, Doggie?”</p>

	<p>He gripped Doggie’s hand. Doggie’s lips grew
	white.</p>

	<p>“I’m glad to welcome you back, Oliver,” he said.
	“But I would have you to know that my name is
	Marmaduke.”</p>

	<p>“Sooner be called Doggie myself, old chap,” said
	Oliver.</p>

	<p>He stepped back, smiling at them all—a handsome
	devil-may-care fellow, tall, tough and supple, his hands
	in the pockets of a sun-stained double-breasted blue
	jacket.</p>

	<p>“We’re indeed glad to see you, my dear boy,”
	said the Dean, recovering equanimity; “but what
	have you been doing all this time? And where on
	earth have you come from?”</p>

	<p>“I’ve just come from the South Seas. Arrived in
	London last evening. This morning I thought I’d
	come and look you up.”</p>

	<p>“But if you had let us know you were coming,
	we should have met you at the station with the car.
	Where’s your luggage?”</p>

	<p>He jerked a hand. “In the road. My man’s
	sitting on it. Oh, don’t worry about him,” he cried
	airily to the protesting Dean. “He’s well trained.
	He’ll go on sitting on it all night.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>“You’ve brought a man—a valet?” asked Peggy.</p>

	<p>“It seems so.”</p>

	<p>“Then you must be getting on.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t think he turns you out very well,” said
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You must really let one of the servants see about
	your things, Oliver,” said Mrs. Conover, moving
	towards the porch. “What will people say?”</p>

	<p>He strode after her, and kissed her. “Oh, you
	dear old Durdlebury Aunt! Now I know I’m in
	England again. I haven’t heard those words for
	years!”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Conover’s hospitable intentions were anticipated
	by the old butler, who advanced to meet them
	with the news that Sir Archibald’s car had been brought
	round. As soon as he recognized Oliver he started
	back, mouth agape.</p>

	<p>“Yes, it’s me all right, Burford,” laughed Oliver.
	“How did I get here? I dropped from the moon.”</p>

	<p>He shook hands with Burford, of whose life he
	had been the plague during his childhood, proclaimed
	him as hardy and unchanging as a gargoyle, and
	instructed him where to find man and luggage.</p>

	<p>The Bruces and the two clerical tennis players
	departed. Marmaduke was for taking his leave too.
	All his old loathing of Oliver had suddenly returned.
	His cousin stood for everything he detested—swagger,
	arrogance, self-assurance. He hated the shabby
	rakishness of his attire, the self-assertive aquiline beak
	of a nose which he had inherited from his father, the
	Rector. He dreaded his aggressive masculinity. He
	had come back with the same insulting speech on his
	lips. His finger-nails were dreadful. Marmaduke
	desired as little as possible of his odious company.
	But his Aunt Sophia cried out:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"> </a>“You’ll surely dine with us to-night, Marmaduke,
	to celebrate Oliver’s return?”</p>

	<p>And Oliver chimed in, “Do! And don’t worry
	about changing,” as Doggie began to murmur excuses,
	“I can’t. I’ve no evening togs. My old ones
	fell to bits when I was trying to put them on, on
	board the steamer, and I had to chuck ’em overboard.
	They turned up a shark, who went for
	’em. So don’t you worry, Doggie, old chap. You
	look as pretty as paint as you are. Doesn’t he,
	Peggy?”</p>

	<p>Peggy, with a slight flush on her cheek, came to the
	rescue and linked her arm in Marmaduke’s.</p>

	<p>“You haven’t had time to learn everything yet,
	Oliver; but I think you ought to know that we are
	engaged.”</p>

	<p>“Holy Gee! Is that so? My compliments.”
	He swept them a low bow. “God bless you, my
	children!”</p>

	<p>“Of course he’ll stay to dinner,” said Peggy; and
	she looked at Oliver as who should say, “Touch him
	at your peril: he belongs to me.”</p>

	<p>So Doggie had to yield. Mrs. Conover went into
	the house to arrange for Oliver’s comfort, and the others
	strolled round the garden.</p>

	<p>“Well, my boy,” said the Dean, “so you’re back
	in the old country?”</p>

	<p>“Turned up again like a bad penny.”</p>

	<p>The Dean’s kindly face clouded. “I hope you’ll
	soon be able to find something to do.”</p>

	<p>“It’s money I want, not work,” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>“Ah!” said the Dean, in a tone so thoughtful
	as just to suggest a lack of sympathy.</p>

	<p>Oliver looked over his shoulder—the Dean and
	himself were preceding Marmaduke and Peggy on the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>trim gravel path. “Do you care to lend me a few
	thousands, Doggie?”</p>

	<p>“Certainly not,” replied Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“There’s family affection for you, Uncle Edward!
	I’ve come half-way round the earth to see him, and—say,
	will you lend me a fiver?”</p>

	<p>“If you need it,” said Marmaduke in a dignified
	way, “I shall be very happy to advance you five
	pounds.”</p>

	<p>Oliver brought the little party to a halt and burst
	into laughter.</p>

	<p>“I believe you good people think I’ve come back
	broke to the world. The black sheep returned like
	a wolf to the fold. Only Peggy drew a correct inference
	from the valet—wait till you see him! As
	Peggy said, I’ve been getting on.” He laid a light
	hand on the Dean’s shoulder. “While all you
	folks in Durdlebury, especially my dear Doggie, for
	the last ten years have been durdling, I’ve been doing.
	I’ve not come all this way to tap relations for five-pound
	notes. I’m swaggering into the City of London
	for Capital—with a great big C.”</p>

	<p>Marmaduke twirled his little moustache. “You’ve
	taken to company promoting,” he remarked acidly.</p>

	<p>“I have. And a damn—I beg your pardon, Uncle
	Edward—we poor Pacific Islanders lisp in damns
	for want of deans to hold us up—and a jolly good
	company too. We—that’s I and another man—that’s
	all the company as yet—two’s company, you
	know—own a trading fleet.”</p>

	<p>“You own ships?” cried Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Rather. Own ’em, sail ’em, navigate ’em,
	stoke ’em, clean out the boilers, sit on the safety valves
	when we want to make speed, do every old thing——”</p>

	<p>“And what do you trade in?” asked the Dean.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>“Copra, bêche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl——”</p>

	<p>“Mother-of-pearl! How awfully romantic!”
	cried Peggy.</p>

	<p>“We’ve got a fishery. At any rate, the concession.
	To work it properly we require capital. That’s
	why I’m here—to turn the concern into a limited
	company.”</p>

	<p>“And where is this wonderful place?” asked the
	Dean.</p>

	<p>“Huaheine.”</p>

	<p>“What a beautiful word!”</p>

	<p>“Isn’t it?” said Oliver. “Like the sigh of a
	girl in her sleep.”</p>

	<p>The old Dean shot a swift glance at his nephew;
	then took his arm and walked on, and looked at the
	vast mass of the cathedral and at the quiet English
	garden in its evening shadow.</p>

	<p>“Copra, bêche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl, Huaheine,”
	he murmured. “And these strange foreign
	things are the commonplaces of your life!”</p>

	<p>Peggy and Marmaduke lagged behind a little. She
	pressed his arm.</p>

	<p>“I’m so glad you’re staying for dinner. I shouldn’t
	like to think you were running away from him.”</p>

	<p>“I was only afraid of losing my temper and making
	a scene,” replied Doggie with dignity.</p>

	<p>“His manners are odious,” said Peggy. “You
	leave him to me.”</p>

	<p>Suddenly the Dean, taking a turn that brought him
	into view of the porch, stopped short.</p>

	<p>“Goodness gracious!” he cried. “Who in the
	world is that?”</p>

	<p>He pointed to a curious object slouching across the
	lawn; a short hirsute man wearing a sailor’s jersey
	and smoking a stump of a blackened pipe. His
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>tousled head was bare; he had very long arms and
	great powerful hands protruded at the end of long
	sinewy wrists from inadequate sleeves. A pair of bright
	eyes shone out of his dark shaggy face, like a Dandy
	Dinmont’s. His nose was large and red. He rolled as
	he walked. Such a sight had never been seen before
	in the Deanery garden.</p>

	<p>“That’s my man. Peggy’s valet,” said Oliver
	airily. “His name is Chipmunk. A beauty, isn’t
	he?”</p>

	<p>“Like master, like man,” murmured Doggie.</p>

	<p>Oliver’s quick ears caught the words intended
	only for Peggy. He smiled brightly.</p>

	<p>“If you knew what a compliment you were paying
	me, Doggie, you wouldn’t have said such a thing.”</p>

	<p>The man seeing the company stare at him, halted,
	took his pipe out of his mouth, and scratched his head.</p>

	<p>“But—er—forgive me, my dear Oliver,” said the
	Dean. “No doubt he is an excellent fellow—but
	don’t you think he might smoke his pipe somewhere
	else?”</p>

	<p>“Of course he might,” said Oliver. “And he
	jolly well shall.” He put his hand to his mouth, sea-fashion—they
	were about thirty yards apart—and
	shouted: “Here, you! What the eternal blazes
	are you doing here?”</p>

	<p>“Please don’t hurt the poor man’s feelings,” said
	the kindly Dean.</p>

	<p>Oliver turned a blank look on his Uncle. “His
	what? Ain’t got any. Not that kind of feelings.”
	He proceeded: “Now then, look lively! Clear out!
	Skidoo!”</p>

	<p>The valet touched his forehead in salute, and—“Where
	am I to go to, Cap’en?”</p>

	<p>“Go to——”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"> </a>Oliver checked himself in time, and turned to the
	Dean.</p>

	<p>“Where shall I tell him to go?” he asked sweetly.</p>

	<p>“The kitchen garden would be the best place,”
	replied the Dean.</p>

	<p>“I think I’d better go and fix him up myself,”
	said Oliver. “A little conversation in his own language
	might be beneficial.”</p>

	<p>“But isn’t he English?” asked Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Born and bred in Wapping,” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>He marched off across the lawn; and, could they
	have heard it, the friendly talk that he had with Chipmunk
	would have made the Saint and the Divines,
	and even the Crusader, Sir Guy de Chevenix, who
	were buried in the cathedral, turn in their tombs.</p>

	<p>Doggie, watching the disappearing Chipmunk,
	Oliver’s knuckles in his neck, said:</p>

	<p>“I think it monstrous of Oliver to bring such a
	disreputable creature down here.”</p>

	<p>Said the Dean: “At any rate, it brings a certain
	excitement into our quiet surroundings.”</p>

	<p>“They must be having the time of their lives in
	the Servants’ Hall,” said Peggy.</p>

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER IV</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">After</span> breakfast the next morning Doggie,
	attired in a green shot-silk dressing-gown,
	entered his own particular room and sat down to think.
	In its way it was a very beautiful room—high, spacious,
	well-proportioned, facing south-east. The wall-paper,
	which he had designed himself, was ivory-white with
	veinings of peacock-blue. Into the ivory-silk curtains
	were woven peacocks in full pride. The cushions
	were ivory and peacock-blue. The chairs, the
	writing-table, the couch, the bookcases, were pure
	Sheraton and Hepplewhite. Vellum-bound books
	filled the cases—Doggie was very particular about his
	bindings. Delicate water-colours alone adorned the
	walls. On his neatly arranged writing-table lay an
	ivory set—inkstand, pen-tray, blotter and calendar.
	Bits of old embroidery harmonizing with the peacock
	shades were spread here and there. A pretty collection
	of eighteenth-century Italian ivory statuettes were
	grouped about the room. A spinet, inlaid with ebony
	and ivory, formed a centre for the arrangement of
	many other musical instruments—a viol, mandolins
	gay with ribbons, a theorbo, flutes and clarinets.
	Through the curtains, draped across an alcove, could
	be guessed the modern monstrosity of a grand piano.
	One tall closed cabinet was devoted to his collection
	of wall-papers. Another, open, to a collection of little
	dogs in china, porcelain, faïence; thousands of them;
	he got them through dealers from all over the world.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"> </a>He had the finest collection in existence, and maintained
	a friendly and learned correspondence with the other
	collector—an elderly, disillusioned Russian prince, who
	lived somewhere near Nijni-Novgorod. On the
	spinet and on the writing-table were great bowls of
	golden <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rayon d’or</em> roses.</p>

	<p>Doggie sat down to think. An unwonted frown
	creased his brow. Several problems distracted him.
	The morning sun streaming into the room disclosed,
	beyond doubt, discolorations, stains and streaks on the
	wall-paper. It would have to be renewed. Already
	he had decided to design something to take its place.
	But last night Peggy had declared her intention to
	turn this abode of bachelor comfort into the drawing-room,
	and to hand over to his personal use some other
	apartment, possibly the present drawing-room, which
	received all the blaze and glare of the afternoon sun.
	What should he do? Live in the sordidness of discoloured
	wall-paper for another year, or go through
	the anxiety of artistic effort and manufacturers’ stupidity
	and delay, to say nothing of the expense, only
	to have the whole thing scrapped before the wedding?
	Doggie had a foretaste of the dilemmas of matrimony.
	He had a gnawing suspicion that the trim and perfect
	life was difficult of attainment.</p>

	<p>Then, meandering through this wilderness of
	dubiety, ran thoughts of Oliver. Every one seemed
	to have gone crazy over him. Uncle Edward and
	Aunt Sophia had hung on his lips while he lied unblushingly
	about his adventures. Even Peggy had listened
	open-eyed and open-mouthed when he had told a tale
	of shipwreck in the South Seas: how the schooner
	had been caught in some beastly wind and the masts
	had been torn out and the rudder carried away, and how
	it had struck a reef, and how something had hit him
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>on the head, and he knew no more till he woke up
	on a beach and found that the unspeakable Chipmunk
	had swum with him for a week—or whatever the time
	was—until they got to land. If hulking, brainless
	dolts like Oliver, thought Doggie, like to fool around
	in schooners and typhoons, they must take the consequences.
	There was nothing to brag about. The
	higher man was the intellectual, the æsthetic, the artistic
	being. What did Oliver know of Lydian modes or
	Louis Treize decoration or Astec clay dogs? Nothing.
	He couldn’t even keep his socks from slopping about
	over his shoes. And there was Peggy all over the
	fellow, although before dinner she had said she couldn’t
	bear the sight of him. Doggie was perturbed. On
	bidding him good night, she had kissed him in the
	most perfunctory manner—merely the cousinly peck of
	a dozen years ago—and had given no thought to the
	fact that he was driving home in an open car without
	an overcoat. He had felt distinctly chilly on his
	arrival, and had taken a dose of ammoniated quinine.
	Was Peggy’s indifference a sign that she had ceased
	to care for him? That she was attracted by the
	buccaneering Oliver?</p>

	<p>Now suppose the engagement was broken off, he
	would be free to do as he chose with the redecoration
	of the room. But suppose, as he sincerely and devoutly
	hoped, it wasn’t? Dilemma on dilemma. Added
	to all this, Goliath, the miniature Belgian griffon,
	having probably overeaten himself, had complicated
	pains inside, and the callous vet. could or would not
	come round till the evening. In the meantime,
	Goliath might die.</p>

	<p>He was at this point of his reflections, when to his
	horror he heard a familiar voice outside the door.</p>

	<p>“All right, Peddle. Don’t worry. I’ll show
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>myself in. Look after that man of mine. Quite
	easy. Give him some beer in a bucket and leave him
	to it.”</p>

	<p>Then the door burst open and Oliver, pipe in
	mouth and hat on one side, came into the room.</p>

	<p>“Hallo, Doggie! Thought I’d look you up.
	Hope I’m not disturbing you.”</p>

	<p>“Not at all,” said Doggie. “Do sit down.”</p>

	<p>But Oliver walked about and looked at things.</p>

	<p>“I like your water-colours. Did you collect
	them yourself?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“I congratulate you on your taste. This is a
	beauty. Who is it by?”</p>

	<p>The appreciation brought Doggie at once to his side.
	Oliver, the connoisseur, was showing himself in a new
	and agreeable light. Doggie took him delightedly
	round the pictures, expounding their merits and their
	little histories. He found that Oliver, although
	unlearned, had a true sense of light and colour and
	tone. He was just beginning to like him, when the
	tactless fellow, stopping before the collection of little
	dogs, spoiled everything.</p>

	<p>“My holy aunt!” he cried—an objurgation which
	Doggie had abhorred from boyhood—and he doubled
	with laughter in his horrid schoolboy fashion—“My
	dear Doggie—is that your family? How many
	litters?”</p>

	<p>“It’s the finest collection of the kind in the world,”
	replied Doggie stiffly, “and is worth several thousand
	pounds.”</p>

	<p>Oliver heaved himself into a chair—that was
	Doggie’s impression of his method of sitting down—a
	Sheraton chair with delicate arms and legs.</p>

	<p>“Forgive me,” he said, “but you’re such a funny
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>devil.”—Doggie gaped. The conception of himself
	as a funny devil was new.—“Pictures and music I
	can understand. But what the deuce is the point of
	these dam little dogs?”</p>

	<p>But Doggie was hurt. “It would be useless to
	try to explain,” said he.</p>

	<p>Oliver took off his hat and sent it skimming on to
	the couch.</p>

	<p>“Look here, old chap,” he said, “I seem to have
	put my foot into it again. I didn’t mean to, really.
	Peggy gave me hell this morning for not treating
	you as a man and a brother, and I came round to try
	to put things right.”</p>

	<p>“It’s very considerate of Peggy, I’m sure,” said
	Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“Now look here, old Doggie——”</p>

	<p>“I told you when we first met yesterday that I
	vehemently object to being called Doggie.”</p>

	<p>“But why?” asked Oliver. “I’ve made inquiries,
	and find that all your pals——”</p>

	<p>“I haven’t any pals, as you call them.”</p>

	<p>“Well, all our male contemporaries in the place
	who have the honour of your acquaintance—they all
	call you Doggie, and you don’t seem to mind.”</p>

	<p>“I do mind,” replied Marmaduke angrily, “but
	as I avoid their company as much as possible, it doesn’t
	very much matter.”</p>

	<p>Oliver stretched out his legs and put his hands
	behind his back—then wriggled to his feet. “What
	a beast of a chair! Anyhow,” he went on, puffing
	at his pipe, “don’t let us quarrel. I’ll call you Marmaduke,
	if you like, when I can remember—it’s a
	beast of a name—like the chair. I’m a rough sort of
	chap. I’ve had ten years’ pretty rough training. I’ve
	slept on boards. I’ve slept in the open without a cent
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>to hire a board. I’ve gone cold and I’ve gone hungry,
	and men have knocked me about and I’ve knocked
	men about—and I’ve lost the Durdlebury sense of
	social values. In the wilds if a man once gets the
	name, say, of Duck-Eyed Joe, it sticks to him, and he
	accepts it and answers to it, and signs ‘Duck-Eyed
	Joe’ on an IOU and honours the signature.”</p>

	<p>“But I’m not in the wilds,” said Marmaduke,
	“and haven’t the slightest intention of ever leading
	the unnatural and frightful life you describe. So
	what you say doesn’t apply to me.”</p>

	<p>“Quite so,” replied Oliver. “That wasn’t the
	moral of my discourse. The habit of mind engendered
	in the wilds applies to me. Just as I could never think
	of Duck-Eyed Joe as George Wilkinson, so you,
	James Marmaduke Trevor, will live imperishably in
	my mind as Doggie. I was making a sort of apology,
	old chap, for my habit of mind.”</p>

	<p>“If it is an apology——” said Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>Oliver, laughing, clapped him boisterously on the
	shoulder. “Oh, you solemn comic cuss!” He
	strode to a rose-bowl and knocked the ashes of his
	pipe into the water—Doggie trembled lest he might
	next squirt tobacco juice over the ivory curtains.
	“You don’t give a fellow a chance. Look here, tell
	me, as man to man, what are you going to do with
	your life? I don’t mean it in the high-brow sense
	of people who live in unsuccessful plays and garden
	cities, but in the ordinary common-sense way of the
	world. Here you are, young, strong, educated,
	intelligent——”</p>

	<p>“I’m not strong,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Oh, shucks! A month’s exercise would make
	you as strong as a mule. Here you are—what the
	blazes are you going to do with yourself?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>“I don’t admit that you have any right to question
	me,” said Doggie, lighting a cigarette.</p>

	<p>“Peggy has given it to me. We had a heart to
	heart talk this morning, I assure you. She called me
	a swaggering, hectoring barbarian. So I told her
	what I’d do. I said I’d come here and squeak like a
	little mouse and eat out of your hand. I also said I’d
	take you out with me to the Islands and give you a
	taste for fresh air and salt water and exercise. I’ll
	teach you how to sail a schooner and how to go about
	barefoot and swab decks. It’s a life for a man out there,
	I tell you. If you’ve nothing better to do than living
	here snug like a flea on a dog’s back, until you get
	married, you’d better come.”</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled pityingly, but said politely:</p>

	<p>“Your offer is very kind, Oliver; but I don’t
	think that kind of life would suit me.”</p>

	<p>“Oh yes it would,” said Oliver. “It would make
	you healthy, wealthy—if you took a fancy to put
	some money into the pearl fishery—and wise. I’d
	show you the world, make a man of you, for Peggy’s
	sake, and teach you how men talk to one another in
	a gale of wind.”</p>

	<p>The door opened and Peddle appeared.</p>

	<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Oliver—but your
	man——”</p>

	<p>“Yes? What about him? Is he misbehaving
	himself? Kissing the maids?”</p>

	<p>“No, sir,” said Peddle—“but none of them can
	get on with their work. He has drunk two quart
	jugs of beer and wants a third.”</p>

	<p>“Well, give it to him.”</p>

	<p>“I shouldn’t like to see the man intoxicated, sir,”
	said Peddle.</p>

	<p>“You couldn’t. No one has or ever will.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>“He is also standing on his head, sir, in the middle
	of the kitchen table.”</p>

	<p>“It’s his great parlour-trick. You just try to do
	it, Peddle—especially after two quarts of beer. He’s
	showing his gratitude, poor chap—just like the juggler
	of Notre-Dame in the story. And I’m sure everybody’s
	enjoying themselves?”</p>

	<p>“The maids are nearly in hysterics, sir.”</p>

	<p>“But they’re quite happy?”</p>

	<p>“Too happy, sir.”</p>

	<p>“Lord!” cried Oliver, “what a lot of stuffy owls
	you are! What do you want me to do? What
	would you like me to do, Doggie? It’s your house.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know,” said Doggie. “I’ve had nothing
	to do with such people. Perhaps you might go and
	speak to him.”</p>

	<p>“No, I won’t do that. I tell you what, Peddle,”
	said Oliver brightly. “You lure him out into the
	stable yard with a great hunk of pie—he adores pie—and
	tell him to sit there and eat it till I come. Tell
	him I said so.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll see what can be done, sir,” said Peddle.</p>

	<p>“I don’t mean to be inhospitable,” said Doggie,
	after the butler had gone, “but why do you take
	this extraordinary person about with you?”</p>

	<p>“I wanted him to see Durdlebury and Durdlebury
	to see him. Do it good,” replied Oliver. “Now,
	what about my proposition? Out there of course
	you’ll be my guest. Put yourself in charge of Chipmunk
	and me for eight months, and you’ll never
	regret it. What Chipmunk doesn’t know about ships
	and drink and hard living isn’t knowledge. We’ll
	let you down easy—treat you kindly—word of
	honour.”</p>

	<p>Doggie being a man of intelligence realized that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"> </a>Oliver’s offer arose from a genuine desire to do him
	some kind of service. But if a friendly bull out of the
	fullness of its affection invited you to accompany
	him to the meadow and eat grass, what could you do
	but courteously decline the invitation? This is what
	Doggie did. After a further attempt at persuasion,
	Oliver grew impatient, and picking up his hat stuck it
	on the side of his head. He was a simple-natured,
	impulsive man. Peggy’s spirited attack had caused him
	to realize that he had treated Doggie with unprovoked
	rudeness; but then, Doggie was such a little worm.
	Suddenly the great scheme for Doggie’s regeneration
	had entered his head, and generously he had rushed to
	begin to put it into execution. The pair were his
	blood relations after all. He saw his way to doing
	them a good turn. Peggy, with all her go—exemplified
	by the manner in which she had gone for him—was
	worth the trouble he proposed to take with Doggie.
	It really was a handsome offer. Most fellows would
	have jumped at the prospect of being shown round
	the Islands with an old hand who knew the whole
	thing backwards, from company promoting to beach-combing.
	He had not expected such a point-blank,
	bland refusal. It made him angry.</p>

	<p>“I’m really most obliged to you, Oliver,” said Doggie
	finally. “But our ideals are so entirely different.
	You’re primitive, you know. You seem to find your
	happiness in defying the elements, whereas I find mine
	in adopting the resources of civilization to circumvent
	them.”</p>

	<p>He smiled, pleased with his little epigram.</p>

	<p>“Which means,” said Oliver, “that you’re afraid
	to roughen your hands and spoil your complexion.”</p>

	<p>“If you like to put it that way—symbolically.”</p>

	<p>“Symbolically be hanged!” cried Oliver, losing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>his temper. “You’re an effeminate little rotter, and
	I’m through with you. Go on and wag your tail and
	sit up and beg for biscuits——”</p>

	<p>“Stop!” shouted Doggie, white with sudden
	anger which shook him from head to foot. He
	marched to the door, his green silk dressing-gown
	flapping round his legs, and threw it wide open.
	“This is my house. I’m sorry to have to ask you
	to get out of it.”</p>

	<p>Oliver looked intently for a few seconds into the
	flaming little dark eyes. Then he said gravely:</p>

	<p>“I’m a beast to have said that. I take it all back.
	Good-bye!”</p>

	<p>“Good day to you,” said Doggie; and when the
	door was shut he went and threw himself, shaken,
	on the couch, hating Oliver and all his works more
	than ever. Go about barefoot and swab decks!
	It was Bedlam madness. Besides being dangerous
	to health, it would be excruciating discomfort. And
	to be insulted for not grasping at such martyrdom. It
	was intolerable.</p>

	<p>Doggie stayed away from the Deanery all that day.
	On the morrow he heard, to his relief, that Oliver
	had returned to London with the unedifying Chipmunk.
	He took Peggy for a drive in the Rolls-Royce,
	and told her of Oliver’s high-handed methods. She
	sympathized. She said, however:</p>

	<p>“Oliver’s a rough diamond.”</p>

	<p>“He’s one of Nature’s non-gentlemen,” said
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>She laughed and patted his arm. “Clever lad!”
	she said.</p>

	<p>So Doggie’s wounded vanity was healed. He confided
	to her some of his difficulties as to the peacock and
	ivory room.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>“Bear with the old paper for my sake,” she said.
	“It’s something you can do for me. In the meanwhile,
	you and I can put our heads together and design
	a topping scheme of decoration. It’s not too early
	to start in right now, for it’ll take months and months
	to get the house just as we want.”</p>

	<p>“You’re the best girl in the world,” said Doggie;
	“and the way you understand me is simply wonderful.”</p>

	<p>“Dear old thing,” smiled Peggy; “you’re no
	great conundrum.”</p>

	<p>Happiness once more settled on Doggie Trevor.
	For the next two or three days he and Peggy tackled the
	serious problem of the reorganization of Denby Hall.
	Peggy had the large ideas of a limited though acute
	brain, stimulated by social ambitions. When she became
	mistress of Denby Hall, she intended to reverse
	the invisible boundary that included it in Durdlebury
	and excluded it from the County. It was to be
	County—of the fine inner Arcanum of County—and
	only Durdlebury by the grace of Peggy Trevor.
	No “durdling,” as Oliver called it, for her. Denby
	Hall was going to be the very latest thing of September,
	1915, when she proposed, the honeymoon concluded,
	to take smart and startling possession. Lots
	of Mrs. Trevor’s rotten old stuffy furniture would
	have to go. Marmaduke would have to revolutionize
	his habits. As she would have all kinds of jolly
	people down to stay, additions must be made to the
	house. Within a week after her engagement she had
	devised all the improvements. Marmaduke’s room,
	with a great bay thrown out, would be the drawing-room.
	The present drawing-room, nucleus of a new
	wing, would be a dancing-room, with parquet flooring;
	when not used for tangos and the fashionable negroid
	dances, it would be called the morning-room; beyond
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>that there would be a billiard-room. Above this first
	floor there could easily be built a series of guest chambers.
	As for Marmaduke’s library, or study, or den,
	any old room would do. There were a couple of
	bedrooms overlooking the stable yard which thrown
	into one would do beautifully.</p>

	<p>With feminine tact she dangled these splendours
	before Doggie’s infatuated eyes, instinctively choosing
	the opportunity of his gratitude for soothing treatment.
	Doggie telegraphed for Sir Owen Julius, R.A., Surveyor
	to the Cathedral, the only architect of his acquaintance.
	The great man sent his partner, plain John Fox,
	who undertook to prepare a design.</p>

	<p>Mr. Fox came down to Durdlebury on the 28th
	of July. There had been a lot of silly talk in the
	newspapers about Austria and Serbia, to which Doggie
	had given little heed. There was always trouble in
	the Balkan States. Recently they had gone to war.
	It had left Doggie quite cold. They were all “Merry
	Widow,” irresponsible people. They dressed in
	queer uniforms and picturesque costumes, and thought
	themselves tremendously important, and were always
	squabbling among themselves and would go on doing
	it till the day of Doom. Now there was more fuss.
	He had read in the <cite>Morning Post</cite> that Sir Edward
	Grey had proposed a Conference of the Great Powers.
	Only sensible thing to do, thought Doggie. He
	dismissed the trivial matter from his mind. On
	the morning of the 29th he learned that Austria had
	declared war on Serbia. Still, what did it matter?</p>

	<p>Doggie had held aloof from politics. He regarded
	them as somewhat vulgar. Conservative by caste,
	he had once, when the opportunity was almost forced
	on him, voted for the Conservative candidate of the
	constituency. European politics on the grand scale
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>did not arouse his interest at all. England, save as
	the wise Mentor, had nothing to do with them. Still,
	if Russia fought, France would have to join her ally.
	It was not till he went to the Deanery that he began
	to contemplate the possibility of a general European
	war. For the next day or two he read his newspapers
	very carefully.</p>

	<p>On Saturday, the 1st of August, Oliver suddenly
	reappeared, proposing to stay over the Bank Holiday.
	He brought news and rumours of war from the great
	city. He had found money very tight, Capital with
	a big C impossible to obtain. Every one told him to
	come back when the present European cloud had
	blown over. In the opinion of the judicious, it would
	not blow over. There was going to be war, and
	England could not stay out of it. The Sunday morning
	papers confirmed all he said. Germany had declared
	war on Russia. France was involved. Would Great
	Britain come in, or for ever lose her honour?</p>

	<p>That warm beautiful Sunday afternoon they sat
	on the peaceful lawn under the shadow of the great
	cathedral. Burford brought out the tea-tray and
	Mrs. Conover poured out tea. Sir Archibald and
	Lady Bruce and their daughter Dorothy were there.
	Doggie, impeccable in dark purple. Nothing clouded
	the centuries-old serenity of the place. Yet they asked
	the question that was asked on every quiet lawn,
	every little scrap of shaded garden throughout the land
	that day: Would England go to war?</p>

	<p>And if she came in, as come in she must, what
	would be the result? All had premonitions of strange
	shifting of destinies. As it was yesterday so it was
	to-day in that gracious shrine of immutability. But
	every one knew in his heart that as it was to-day so
	would it not be to-morrow. The very word “war”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>seemed as out of place as the suggestion of Hell in
	Paradise. Yet the throb of the War Drum came
	over the broad land of France and over the sea and half
	over England, and its echo fell upon the Deanery
	garden, flung by the flying buttresses and piers and
	towers of the grey cathedral.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">On the morning of Wednesday, the 5th of August,
	it thundered all over the Close. The ultimatum to
	Germany as to Belgium had expired the night before.
	We were at war.</p>

	<p>“Thank God,” said the Dean at breakfast, “we
	needn’t cast down our eyes and slink by when we meet
	a Frenchman.”</p>

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER V</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> first thing that brought the seriousness of the
	war home to Doggie was a letter from John
	Fox. John Fox, a major in a Territorial regiment,
	was mobilized. He regretted that he could not give
	his personal attention to the proposed alterations at
	Denby Hall. Should the plans be proceeded with in
	his absence from the office, or would Mr. Trevor
	care to wait till the end of the war, which, from the
	nature of things, could not last very long? Doggie
	trotted off to Peggy. She was greatly annoyed.</p>

	<p>“What awful rot!” she cried. “Fox, a major of
	artillery! I’d just as soon trust you with a gun.
	Why doesn’t he stick to his architecture?”</p>

	<p>“He’d be shot or something if he refused to go,”
	said Doggie. “But why can’t we turn it over to Sir
	Owen Julius?”</p>

	<p>“That old archæological fossil?”</p>

	<p>Peggy, womanlike, forgot that they had approached
	him in the first place.</p>

	<p>“He’d never begin to understand what we want.
	Fox hinted as much. Now Fox is modern and up to
	date and sympathetic. If I can’t have Fox, I won’t
	have Sir Owen. Why, he’s older than Dad! He’s
	decrepit. Can’t we get another architect?”</p>

	<p>“Do you think, dear,” said Doggie, “that, in the
	circumstances, it would be a nice thing to do?”</p>

	<p>She flashed a glance at him. She had woven no
	young girl’s romantic illusions around Marmaduke.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>Should necessity have arisen, she could have furnished
	you with a merciless analysis of his character. But
	in that analysis she would have frankly included a very
	fine sense of honour. If he said a thing wasn’t quite
	nice—well, it wasn’t quite nice.</p>

	<p>“I suppose it wouldn’t,” she admitted. “We
	shall have to wait. But it’s a rotten nuisance all the
	same.”</p>

	<p>Hundreds of thousands of not very intelligent,
	but at the same time by no means unpatriotic, people,
	like Peggy, at the beginning of the war thought trivial
	disappointments rotten nuisances. We had all waxed
	too fat during the opening years of the twentieth century,
	and, not having a spiritual ideal in God’s universe,
	we were in danger of perishing from Fatty Degeneration
	of the Soul. As it was, it took a year or more of
	war to cure us.</p>

	<p>It took Peggy quite a month to appreciate the
	meaning of the mobilization of Major Fox, R.F.A.
	A brigade of Territorial artillery flowed over Durdlebury,
	and the sacred and sleepy meadows became a
	mass of guns and horse-lines and men in khaki, and
	waggons and dingy canvas tents—and the old quiet
	streets were thick with unaccustomed soldiery. The
	Dean called on the Colonel and officers, and soon the
	house was full of eager young men holding the King’s
	commission. Doggie admired their patriotism, but
	disliked their whole-hearted embodiment of the
	military spirit. They seemed to have no ideas beyond
	their new trade. The way they clanked about in
	their great boots and spurs got on his nerves. He
	dreaded also lest Peggy should be affected by the
	meretricious attraction of a uniform. There were
	fine hefty fellows among the visitors at the Deanery,
	on whom Peggy looked with natural admiration.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>Doggie bitterly confided to Goliath that it was the
	“glamour of brawn.” It never entered his head
	during those early days that all the brawn of all the
	manhood of the nation would be needed. We had our
	well-organized Army and Navy, composed of peculiarly
	constituted men whose duty it was to fight;
	just as we had our well-organized National Church,
	also composed of peculiarly constituted men whose
	duty it was to preach. He regarded himself as remote
	from one as from the other.</p>

	<p>Oliver, who had made a sort of peace with Doggie
	and remained at the Deanery, very quickly grew
	restless.</p>

	<p>One day, walking with Peggy and Marmaduke
	in the garden, he said: “I wish I could get hold of
	that confounded fellow, Chipmunk!”</p>

	<p>Partly through deference to the good Dean’s delicately
	hinted distaste for that upsetter of decorous
	households, and partly to allow his follower to attend
	to his own domestic affairs, he had left Chipmunk in
	London. Fifteen years ago Chipmunk had parted
	from a wife somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
	East India Docks. Both being illiterate, neither had
	since communicated with the other. As he had left
	her earning good money in a factory, his fifteen years’
	separation had been relieved from anxiety as to her
	material welfare. A prudent, although a beer-loving
	man, he had amassed considerable savings, and it was
	the dual motive of sharing these with his wife and of
	protecting his patron from the ever-lurking perils
	of London, that had brought him across the seas.
	When Oliver had set him free in town, he was going
	in quest of his wife. But as he had forgotten the name
	of the street near the East India Docks where his
	wife lived, and the name of the factory in which she
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>worked, the successful issue of the quest, in Oliver’s
	opinion, seemed problematical. The simple Chipmunk,
	however, was quite sanguine. He would run
	into her all right. As soon as he had found her he
	would let the Captain know. Up to the present he
	had not communicated with the Captain. He could
	give the Captain no definite address, so the Captain
	could not communicate with him. Chipmunk had
	disappeared into the unknown.</p>

	<p>“Isn’t he quite capable of taking care of himself?”
	asked Peggy.</p>

	<p>“I’m not so sure,” replied Oliver. “Besides,
	he’s hanging me up. I’m kind of responsible for him,
	and I’ve got sixty pounds of his money. It’s all I
	could do to persuade him not to stow the lot in his
	pocket, so as to divide it with Mrs. Chipmunk as soon
	as he saw her. I must find out what has become of
	the beggar before I move.”</p>

	<p>“I suppose,” said Doggie, “you’re anxious now
	to get back to the South Seas?”</p>

	<p>Oliver stared at him. “No, sonny, not till the
	war’s over.”</p>

	<p>“Why, you wouldn’t be in any great danger out
	there, would you?”</p>

	<p>Oliver laughed. “You’re the funniest duck that
	ever was, Doggie. I’ll never get to the end of you.”
	And he strolled away.</p>

	<p>“What does he mean?” asked the bewildered
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>“I think,” replied Peggy, smiling, “that he means
	he’s going to fight.”</p>

	<p>“Oh,” said Doggie. Then after a pause he added,
	“He’s just the sort of chap for a soldier, isn’t he?”</p>

	<p>The next day Oliver’s anxiety as to Chipmunk was
	relieved by the appearance of the man himself, incredibly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>dirty and dusty and thirsty. Having found no
	trace of his wife, and having been robbed of the money
	he carried about him, he had tramped to Durdlebury,
	where he reported himself to his master as if nothing
	out of the way had happened.</p>

	<p>“You silly blighter,” said Oliver. “Suppose I
	had let you go with your other sixty pounds, you would
	have been pretty well in the soup, wouldn’t you?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, Cap’en,” said Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>“And you’re not going on any blethering idiot wild-goose
	chases after wives and such-like truck again, are
	you?”</p>

	<p>“No, Cap’en,” said Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>This was in the stable-yard, after Chipmunk had
	shaken some of the dust out of his hair and clothes
	and had eaten and drunk voraciously. He was now
	sitting on an upturned bucket and smoking his clay
	pipe with an air of solid content. Oliver, lean and
	supple, his hands in his pockets, looked humorously
	down upon him.</p>

	<p>“And you’ve got to stick to me for the future,
	like a roseate leech.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, Cap’en.”</p>

	<p>“You’re going to ride a horse.”</p>

	<p>“A wot?” roared Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>“A thing on four legs, that kicks like hell.”</p>

	<p>“Wotever for? I ain’t never ridden no ’osses.”</p>

	<p>“You’re going to learn, you unmilitary-looking,
	worm-eaten scab. You’ve got to be a ruddy soldier.”</p>

	<p>“Gorblime!” said Chipmunk, “that’s the first I
	’eard of it. A ’oss soldier? You’re not kiddin’,
	are you, Cap’en?”</p>

	<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

	<p>“Gorblime! Who would ha’ thought it?”
	Then he spat lustily and sucked at his pipe.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"> </a>“You’ve nothing to say against it, have you?”</p>

	<p>“No, Cap’en.”</p>

	<p>“All right. And look here, when we’re in the
	army you must chuck calling me Cap’en.”</p>

	<p>“What shall I have to call yer? Gineral?”
	Chipmunk asked simply.</p>

	<p>“Mate, Bill, Joe—any old name.”</p>

	<p>“Ker-ist!” said Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>“Do you know why we’re going to enlist?”</p>

	<p>“Can’t say as ’ow I does, Cap’en.”</p>

	<p>“You chuckle-headed swab! Don’t you know
	we’re at war?”</p>

	<p>“I did ’ear some talk about it in a pub one night,”
	Chipmunk admitted. “’Oo are we fighting? Dutchmen
	or Dagoes?”</p>

	<p>“Dutchmen.”</p>

	<p>Chipmunk spat in his horny hands, rubbed them
	together and smiled. As each individual hair on his face
	seemed to enter into the smile, the result was sinister.</p>

	<p>“Do you remember that Dutchman at Samoa,
	Cap’en?”</p>

	<p>Oliver smiled back. He remembered the hulking,
	truculent German merchant whom Chipmunk, having
	half strangled, threw into the sea. He also remembered
	the amount of accomplished lying he had to
	practise in order to save Chipmunk from the clutches
	of the law and get away with the schooner.</p>

	<p>“We leave here to-morrow,” said Oliver. “In
	the meanwhile you’ll have to shave your ugly face.”</p>

	<p>For the first time Chipmunk was really staggered.
	He gaped at Oliver’s retiring figure. Even his limited
	and time-worn vocabulary failed him. The desperate
	meaning of the war has flashed suddenly on millions
	of men in millions of different ways. This is the
	way in which it flashed on Chipmunk.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>He sat on his bucket pondering over the awfulness
	of it and sucking his pipe long after it had been smoked
	out. The Dean’s car drove into the yard and the
	chauffeur, stripping off his coat, prepared to clean it
	down.</p>

	<p>“Say, guv’nor,” said Chipmunk hoarsely, “what
	do you think of this ’ere war?”</p>

	<p>“Same as most people,” replied the chauffeur tersely.
	He shared in the general disapproval of Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>“But see ’ere. Cap’en he tells me I must shave me
	face and be a ’oss soldier. I never shaved me face in
	me life, and I dunno ’ow to do it, just as I dunno ’ow
	to ride a ’oss. I’m a sailorman, I am, and sailormen
	don’t shave their faces and ride ’osses. That’s why I
	arsked yer what yer thought of this ’ere war.”</p>

	<p>The chauffeur struggled into his jeans and adjusted
	them before replying.</p>

	<p>“If you’re a sailor, the place for you is the navy,”
	he remarked in a superior manner. “As for the
	cavalry, the Cap’en, as you call him, ought to have
	more sense——”</p>

	<p>Chipmunk rose and swung his long arms threateningly.</p>

	<p>“Look ’ere, young feller, do you want to have your
	blinkin’ ’ead knocked orf? Where the Cap’en goes,
	I goes, and don’t you make any mistake about it!”</p>

	<p>“I didn’t say anything,” the chauffeur expostulated.</p>

	<p>“Then don’t say it. See? Keep your blinkin’ ’ead
	shut and mind your own business.”</p>

	<p>And, scowling fiercely and thrusting his empty
	pipe into his trousers pocket, Chipmunk rolled away.</p>

	<p>A few hours later Oliver, entering his room to dress
	for dinner, found him standing in the light of the
	window laboriously fitting studs into a shirt. The
	devoted fellow having gone to report to his master,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>had found Burford engaged in his accustomed task of
	laying out his master’s evening clothes—Oliver during
	his stay in London had provided himself with these
	necessaries. A jealous snarl had sent Burford flying.
	So intent was he on his work, that he did not hear
	Oliver enter. Oliver stood and watched him. Chipmunk
	was swearing wholesomely under his breath.
	Oliver saw him take up the tail of the shirt, spit on it
	and begin to rub something.</p>

	<p>“Ker-ist!” said Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>“What in the thundering blazes are you doing
	there?” cried Oliver.</p>

	<p>Chipmunk turned.</p>

	<p>“Oh, my God!” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>Then he sank on a chair and laughed and laughed,
	and the more he looked at Chipmunk the more he
	laughed. And Chipmunk stood stolid, holding the
	shirt of the awful, wet, thumb-marked front. But
	it was not at the shirt that Oliver laughed.</p>

	<p>“Good God!” he cried, “were you born like
	that?”</p>

	<p>For Chipmunk, having gone to the barber’s, was
	clean-shaven, and revealed himself as one of the
	most comically ugly of the sons of men.</p>

	<p>“Never mind,” said Oliver, after a while, “you’ve
	made the sacrifice for your country.”</p>

	<p>“And wot if I get the face-ache?”</p>

	<p>“I’d get something that looked like a face before
	I’d talk of it,” grinned Oliver.</p>

	<p>At the family dinner-table, Doggie being present,
	he announced his intentions. It was the duty of
	every able-bodied man to fight for the Empire. Had
	not half a million just been called for? We should
	want a jolly sight more than that before we got through
	with it. Anyway, he was off to-morrow.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"> </a>“To-morrow?” echoed the Dean.</p>

	<p>Burford, who was handing him potatoes, arched
	his eyebrows in alarm. He was fond of Oliver.</p>

	<p>“With Chipmunk.”</p>

	<p>Burford uttered an unheard sigh of relief.</p>

	<p>“We’re going to enlist in King Edward’s Horse.
	They’re our kind. Overseas men. Lots of ’em what
	you dear good people would call bad eggs. There you
	make the mistake. Perhaps they mayn’t be fresh
	enough raw for a dainty palate—but for cooking,
	good hard cooking, by gosh! nothing can touch
	’em.”</p>

	<p>“You talk of enlisting, dear,” said Mrs. Conover.
	“Does that mean as a private soldier?”</p>

	<p>“Yes—a trooper. Why not?”</p>

	<p>“You’re a gentleman, dear. And gentlemen in
	the Army are officers.”</p>

	<p>“Not now, my dear Sophia,” said the Dean.
	“Gentlemen are crowding into the ranks. They are
	setting a noble example.”</p>

	<p>They argued it out in their gentle old-fashioned way.
	The Dean quoted examples of sons of family who had
	served as privates in the South African War.</p>

	<p>“And that to this,” said he, “is but an eddy to a
	maelstrom.”</p>

	<p>“Come and join us, James Marmaduke,” said
	Oliver across the table. “Chipmunk and me.
	Three ‘sworn brothers to France.’”</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled easily. “I’m afraid I can’t undertake
	to swear a fraternal affection for Chipmunk.
	He and I would have neither habits nor ideals in
	common.”</p>

	<p>Oliver turned to Peggy. “I wish,” said he, with
	rare restraint, “he wouldn’t talk like a book on
	deportment.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"> </a>“Marmaduke talks the language of civilization,”
	laughed Peggy. “He’s not a savage like you.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t you jolly well wish he was!” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>Peggy flushed. “No, I don’t!” she declared.</p>

	<p>The Dean being called away on business immediately
	after dinner, the young men were left alone in
	the dining-room when the ladies had departed. Oliver
	poured himself out a glass of port and filled his pipe—an
	inelegant proceeding of which Doggie disapproved.
	A pipe alone was barbaric, a pipe with
	old port was criminal. He held his peace however.</p>

	<p>“James Marmaduke,” said Oliver, after a while,
	“what are you going to do?” Much as Marmaduke
	disliked the name of “Doggie,” he winced under the
	irony of the new appellation.</p>

	<p>“I don’t see that I’m called upon to do anything,”
	he replied.</p>

	<p>Oliver smoked and sipped his port. “I don’t want
	to hurt your feelings any more,” said he gravely,
	“though sometimes I’d like to scrag you—I suppose
	because you’re so different from me. It was so when
	we were children together. Now I’ve grown very
	fond of Peggy. Put on the right track, she might
	turn into a very fine woman.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t think we need discuss Peggy, Oliver,”
	said Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“I do. She is sticking to you very loyally.”
	Oliver was a bit of an idealist. “The time may come
	when she’ll be up the devil’s own tree. She’ll develop
	a patriotic conscience. If she sticks to you while you
	do nothing she’ll be miserable. If she chucks you,
	as she probably will, she’ll be no happier. It’s all up
	to you, James Doggie Marmaduke, old son. You’ll
	have to gird up your loins and take sword and buckler
	and march away like the rest. I don’t want Peggy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"> </a>to be unhappy. I want her to marry a man. That’s
	why I proposed to take you out with me to Huaheine
	and try to make you one. But that’s over. Now,
	here’s the real chance. Better take it sooner than
	later. You’ll have to be a soldier, Doggie.”</p>

	<p>His pipe not drawing, he was preparing to dig it
	with the point of a dessert-knife, when Doggie interposed
	hurriedly.</p>

	<p>“For goodness’ sake, don’t do that! It makes
	cold shivers run down my back!”</p>

	<p>Oliver looked at him oddly, put the extinct pipe
	in his dinner-jacket pocket and rose.</p>

	<p>“A flaw in the dainty and divine ordering of things
	makes you shiver now, old Doggie. What will you
	do when you see a fellow digging out another fellow’s
	intestines with the point of a bayonet? A bigger
	flaw there somehow!”</p>

	<p>“Don’t talk like that. You make me sick,” said
	Doggie.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_VI"><a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER VI</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">During</span> the next few months there happened
	terrible and marvellous things, which are all
	set down in the myriad chronicles of the time; which
	shook the world and brought the unknown phenomenon
	of change into the Close of Durdlebury. Folks
	of strange habit and speech walked in it, and, gazing
	at the Gothic splendour of the place, saw through the
	mist of autumn and the mist of tears not Durdlebury
	but Louvain. More than one of those grey houses
	flanking the cathedral and sharing with it the continuity
	of its venerable life, was a house of mourning; not
	for loss in the inevitable and not unkindly way of
	human destiny as understood and accepted with long
	disciplined resignation—but for loss sudden, awful,
	devastating; for the gallant lad who had left it but
	a few weeks before, with a smile on his lips, and a
	new and dancing light of manhood in his eyes, now
	with those eyes unclosed and glazed staring at the pitiless
	Flanders sky. Not one of those houses but was linked
	with a battlefield. Beyond the memory of man the
	reader of the Litany had droned the accustomed invocation
	on behalf of the Sovereign and the Royal
	Family, the Bishops, Priests and Deacons, the Lords
	of the Council and all prisoners and captives, and the
	congregation had lumped them all together in their
	responses with an undifferentiating convention of
	fervour. What had prisoners and captives, any more
	than the Lords of the Council, to do with their lives,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"> </a>their hearts, their personal emotions? But now—Durdlebury
	men were known to be prisoners in German
	hands, and after “all prisoners and captives”
	there was a long and pregnant silence, in which was
	felt the reverberation of war against pier and vaulted
	arch and groined roof of the cathedral, which was
	broken too, now and then, by the stifled sob of a
	woman, before the choir came in with the response
	so new and significant in its appeal—“We beseech
	thee to hear us, O Lord!”</p>

	<p>And in every home the knitting-needles of women
	clicked, as they did throughout the length and breadth
	of the land. And the young men left shop and trade
	and counting-house. And young parsons fretted, and
	some obtained the Bishop’s permission to become Army
	chaplains, and others, snapping their fingers (figuratively)
	under the Bishop’s nose, threw their cassocks
	to the nettles and put on the full (though in modern
	times not very splendiferous) panoply of war. And
	in course of time the brigade of artillery rolled away
	and new troops took their place; and Marmaduke
	Trevor, Esquire, of Denby Hall, was called upon to
	billet a couple of officers and twenty men.</p>

	<p>Doggie was both patriotic and polite. Having a
	fragment of the British Army in his house, he did
	his best to make them comfortable. By January he
	had no doubt that the Empire was in peril, that it
	was every man’s duty to do his bit. He welcomed
	the new-comers with open arms, having unconsciously
	abandoned his attitude of superiority over mere brawn.
	Doggie saw the necessity of brawn. The more the
	better. It was every patriotic Englishman’s duty to
	encourage brawn. If the two officers had allowed
	him, he would have fed his billeted men every two
	hours on prime beefsteaks and burgundy. He threw
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"> </a>himself heart and soul into the reorganization of his
	household. Officers and men found themselves in
	clover. The officers had champagne every night for
	dinner. They thought Doggie a capital fellow.</p>

	<p>“My dear chap,” they would say, “you’re spoiling
	us. I don’t say we don’t like it and aren’t grateful.
	We jolly well are. But we’re supposed to rough it—to
	lead the simple life—what? You’re doing us
	too well.”</p>

	<p>“Impossible!” Doggie would reply, filling up the
	speaker’s glass. “Don’t I know what we owe to you
	fellows? In what other way can a helpless, delicate
	crock like myself show his gratitude and in some sort
	of little way serve his country?”</p>

	<p>When the sympathetic and wine-filled guest would
	ask what was the nature of his malady, he would tap
	his chest vaguely and reply:</p>

	<p>“Constitutional. I’ve never been able to do things
	like other fellows. The least thing bowls me out.”</p>

	<p>“Dam hard lines—especially just now.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, isn’t it?” Doggie would answer. And once
	he found himself adding, “I’m fed up with doing
	nothing.”</p>

	<p>Here can be noted a distinct stage in Doggie’s
	development. He realized the brutality of fact.
	When great German guns were yawning open-mouthed
	at you, it was no use saying, “Take the nasty, horrid
	things away, I don’t like them.” They wouldn’t
	go unless you took other big guns and fired at them.
	And more guns were required than could be manned
	by the peculiarly constituted fellows who made up
	the artillery of the original British Army. New
	fellows not at all warlike, peaceful citizens who had
	never killed a cat in anger, were being driven by
	patriotism and by conscience to man them. Against
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"> </a>Blood and Iron now supreme, the superior, æsthetic
	and artistic being was of no avail. You might lament
	the fall in relative values of collections of wall-papers
	and little china dogs, as much as you liked; but you
	could not deny the fall; they had gone down with
	something of an ignoble “wallop.” Doggie began
	to set a high value on guns and rifles and such-like
	deadly engines, and to inquire petulantly why the
	Government were not providing them at greater
	numbers and at greater speed. On his periodic visits
	to London he wandered round by Trafalgar Square
	and Whitehall, to see for himself how the recruiting
	was going on. At the Deanery he joined in ardent
	discussions of the campaign in Flanders. On the
	walls of his peacock and ivory room were maps stuck
	all over with little pins. When he told the young
	officer that he was wearied of inaction, he spoke the
	truth. He began to feel mightily aggrieved against
	Providence for keeping him outside this tremendous
	national league of youth. He never questioned his
	physical incapacity. It was as real a fact as the
	German guns. He went about pitying himself and
	seeking pity.</p>

	<p>The months passed. The regiment moved away
	from Durdlebury, and Doggie was left alone in Denby
	Hall.</p>

	<p>He felt solitary and restless. News came from
	Oliver that he had been offered and had accepted an
	infantry commission, and that Chipmunk, having none
	of the special qualities of a “’oss soldier,” had, by certain
	skilful wire-pullings, been transferred to his regiment,
	and had once more become his devoted servant.
	“A month of this sort of thing,” he wrote, “would
	make our dear old Doggie sit up.” Doggie sighed.
	If only he had been blessed with Oliver’s constitution!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"> </a>One morning Briggins, his chauffeur, announced
	that he could stick it no longer and was going to join
	up. Then Doggie remembered a talk he had had
	with one of the young officers who had expressed
	astonishment at his not being able to drive a car. “I
	shouldn’t have the nerve,” he had replied. “My
	nerves are all wrong—and I shouldn’t have the
	strength to change tyres and things.”… If his
	chauffeur went, he would find it very difficult to get
	another. Who would drive the Rolls-Royce?</p>

	<p>“Why not learn to drive yourself, sir?” said
	Briggins. “Not the Rolls-Royce. I would put it
	up or get rid of it, if I were you. If you engage a
	second-rate man, as you’ll have to, who isn’t used to
	this make of car, he’ll do it in for you pretty quick.
	Get a smaller one in its place and drive it yourself.
	I’ll undertake to teach you enough before I go.”</p>

	<p>So Doggie, following Briggins’ advice, took lessons
	and, to his amazement, found that he did not die of
	nervous collapse when a dog crossed the road in front
	of the car and that the fitting of detachable wheels
	did not require the strength of a Hercules. The first
	time he took Peggy out in the two-seater he swelled
	with pride.</p>

	<p>“I’m so glad to see you can do something!” she
	said.</p>

	<p>Although she was kind and as mildly affectionate
	as ever, he had noticed of late a curious reserve in her
	manner. Conversation did not flow easily. There
	seemed to be something at the back of her mind.
	She had fits of abstraction from which, when rallied,
	she roused herself with an effort.</p>

	<p>“It’s the war,” she would declare. “It’s affecting
	everybody that way.”</p>

	<p>Gradually Doggie began to realize that she spoke
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"> </a>truly. Most people of his acquaintance, when he
	was by, seemed to be thus afflicted. The lack of
	interest they manifested in his delicacy of constitution
	was almost impolite. At last he received an anonymous
	letter, “For little Doggie Trevor, from the
	girls of Durdlebury,” enclosing a white feather.</p>

	<p>The cruelty of it broke Doggie down. He sat in
	his peacock and ivory room and nearly wept. Then
	he plucked up courage and went to Peggy. She was
	rather white about the lips as she listened.</p>

	<p>“I’m sorry,” she said, “but I expected something
	of the sort to happen.”</p>

	<p>“It’s brutal and unjust.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, it’s brutal,” she admitted coldly.</p>

	<p>“I thought you, at any rate, would sympathize
	with me,” he cried.</p>

	<p>She turned on him. “And what about me? Who
	sympathizes with me? Do you ever give a moment’s
	thought to what I’ve had to go through the last few
	months?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t quite know what you mean,” he stammered.</p>

	<p>“I should have thought it was obvious. You can’t
	be such an innocent babe as to suppose people don’t
	talk about you. They don’t talk to you because they
	don’t like to be rude. They send you white feathers
	instead. But they talk to me. ‘Why isn’t Marmaduke
	in khaki?’ ‘Why isn’t Doggie fighting?’
	‘I wonder how you can allow him to slack about like
	that!’—I’ve had a pretty rough time fighting your
	battles, I can tell you, and I deserve some credit. I
	want sympathy just as much as you do.”</p>

	<p>“My dear,” said Doggie, feeling very much humiliated,
	“I never knew. I never thought. I do see
	now the unpleasant position you’ve been in. People
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"> </a>are brutes. But,” he added eagerly, “you told them
	the real reason?”</p>

	<p>“What’s that?” she asked, looking at him with
	cold eyes.</p>

	<p>Then Doggie knew that the wide world was against
	him. “I’m not fit. I’ve no constitution. I’m an
	impossibility.”</p>

	<p>“You thought you had nerves until you learned to
	drive the car. Then you discovered that you hadn’t.
	You fancy you’ve a weak heart. Perhaps if you
	learned to walk thirty miles a day you would discover
	you hadn’t that either. And so with the rest of it.”</p>

	<p>“This is very painful,” he said, going to the window
	and staring out. “Very painful. You are of the
	same opinion as the young women who sent me that
	abominable thing.”</p>

	<p>She had been on the strain for a long while and
	something inside her had snapped. At his woebegone
	attitude she relented however, and came up and
	touched his shoulder.</p>

	<p>“A girl wants to feel some pride in the man she’s
	going to marry. It’s horrible to have to be always
	defending him—especially when she’s not sure she’s
	telling the truth in his defence.”</p>

	<p>He swung round horrified. “Do you think I’m
	shamming, so as to get out of serving in the Army?”</p>

	<p>“Not consciously. Unconsciously, I think you
	are. What does your doctor say?”</p>

	<p>Doggie was taken aback. He had no doctor. He
	had not consulted one for years, having no cause for
	medical advice. The old family physician who had
	attended his mother in her last illness and had prescribed
	Gregory powders for him as a child, had retired
	from Durdlebury long ago. There was only one
	person living familiar with his constitution, and that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"> </a>was himself. He made confession of the surprising
	fact. Peggy made a little gesture.</p>

	<p>“That proves it. I don’t believe you have anything
	wrong with you. The nerves business made
	me sceptical. This is straight talking. It’s horrid,
	I know. But it’s best to get through with it once
	and for all.”</p>

	<p>Some men would have taken deep offence and,
	consigning Peggy to the devil, have walked out of the
	room. But Doggie, a conscientious, even though a
	futile human being, was gnawed for the first time by
	the suspicion that Peggy might possibly be right. He
	desired to act honourably.</p>

	<p>“I’ll do,” said he, “whatever you think proper.”</p>

	<p>Peggy was swift to smite the malleable iron. To
	use the conventional phrase might give an incorrect
	impression of red-hot martial ardour on the part of
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Good,” she said, with the first smile of the day.
	“I’ll hold you to it. But it will be an honourable
	bargain. Get Dr. Murdoch to overhaul you thoroughly,
	with a view to the Army. If he passes you,
	take a commission. Dad says he can easily get you
	one through his old friend General Gadsby at the
	War Office. If he doesn’t, and you’re unfit, I’ll
	stick to you through thick and thin, and make the
	young women of Durdlebury wish they’d never been
	born.”</p>

	<p>She put out her hand. Doggie took it.</p>

	<p>“Very well,” said he, “I agree.”</p>

	<p>She laughed, and ran to the door.</p>

	<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

	<p>“To the telephone—to ring up Dr. Murdoch for
	an appointment.”</p>

	<p>“You’re flabby,” said Dr. Murdoch the next
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"> </a>morning to an anxious Doggie in pink pyjamas; “but
	that’s merely a matter of unused muscles. Physical
	training will set it right in no time. Otherwise, my
	dear Trevor, you’re in splendid health. I was afraid
	your family history might be against you—the child
	of elderly parents, and so forth. But nothing of the
	sort. Not only are you a first-class life for an insurance
	company, but you’re a first-class life for the Army—and
	that’s saying a good deal. There’s not a flaw
	in your whole constitution.”</p>

	<p>He put away his stethoscope and smiled at Doggie,
	who regarded him blankly as the pronouncer of a
	doom. He went on to prescribe a course of physical
	exercises, so many miles a day walking, such and
	such back-breaking and contortional performances in
	his bathroom; if possible, a skilfully graduated career
	in a gymnasium, but his words fell on the ears of a
	Doggie in a dream; and when he had ended, Doggie
	said:</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid, Doctor, you’ll have to write all that
	out for me.”</p>

	<p>“With pleasure,” smiled the doctor, and gripped
	him by the hand. And seeing Doggie wince, he
	said heartily: “Ah! I’ll soon set that right for you.
	I’ll get you something—an india-rubber contrivance
	to practise with for half an hour a day, and you’ll
	develop a hand like a gorilla’s.”</p>

	<p>Dr. Murdoch grinned his way, in his little car, to
	his next patient. Here was this young slacker, coddled
	from birth, absolutely horse-strong and utterly confounded
	at being told so. He grinned and chuckled
	so much that he nearly killed his most valuable old
	lady patient, who was crossing the High Street.</p>

	<p>But Doggie crept out of bed and put on a violet
	dressing-gown that clashed horribly with his pink
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"> </a>pyjamas, and wandered like a man in a nightmare
	to his breakfast. But he could not eat. He swallowed
	a cup of coffee and sought refuge in his own room.
	He was frightened. Horribly frightened, caught in
	a net from which there was no escape—not the tiniest
	break of a mesh. He had given his word—and in
	justice to Doggie, be it said that he held his word
	sacred—he had given his word to join the Army if
	he should be passed by Murdoch. He had been
	passed—more than passed. He would have to join.
	He would have to fight. He would have to live in
	a muddy trench, sleep in mud, eat in mud, plough
	through mud, in the midst of falling shells and other
	instruments of death. And he would be an officer,
	with all kinds of strange and vulgar men under him,
	men like Chipmunk, for instance, whom he would
	never understand. He was almost physically sick with
	apprehension. He realized that he had never commanded
	a man in his life. He had been mortally
	afraid of Briggins, his late chauffeur. He had heard
	that men at the front lived on some solid horror called
	bully-beef dug out of tins, and some liquid horror
	called cocoa, also drunk out of tins; that men kept
	on their clothes, even their boots, for weeks at a time;
	that rats ran over them while they tried to sleep;
	that lice, hitherto associated in his mind with the most
	revolting type of tramp, out there made no distinction
	of persons. They were the common lot of the lowest
	Tommy and the finest gentleman. And then the
	fighting. The noise of the horrid guns. The disgusting
	sights of men shattered to bloody bits. The
	horrible stench. The terror of having one’s face shot
	half away and being an object of revolt and horror
	to all beholders for the rest of life. Death. Feverishly
	he ruffled his comely hair. Death. He was surprised
	<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"> </a>that the contemplation of it did not freeze the
	blood in his veins. Yes. He put it clearly before
	him. He had given his word to Peggy that he would
	go and expose himself to Death. Death. What did
	it mean? He had been brought up in orthodox
	Church of England Christianity. His flaccid mind
	had never questioned the truth of its dogmas. He
	believed, in a general sort of way, that good people
	went to Heaven and bad people went to Hell. His
	conscience was clear. He had never done any harm
	to anybody. As far as he knew, he had broken none
	of the Ten Commandments. In a technical sense
	he was a miserable sinner, and so proclaimed himself
	once a week. But though, perhaps, he had done
	nothing in his life to merit eternal bliss in Paradise,
	yet, on the other hand, he had committed no action
	which would justify a kindly and just Creator in
	consigning him to the eternal flames of Hell. Somehow
	the thought of Death did not worry him. It
	faded from his mind, being far less terrible than life
	under prospective conditions. Discomfort, hunger,
	thirst, cold, fatigue, pain; above all the terror of his
	fellows—these were the soul-racking anticipations of
	this new life into which it was a matter of honour for
	him to plunge. And to an essential gentleman like
	Doggie a matter of honour was a matter of life. And
	so, dressed in his pink pyjamas and violet dressing-gown,
	amid the peacock-blue and ivory hangings of
	his boudoir room, and stared at by the countless unsympathetic
	eyes of his little china dogs, Doggie Trevor
	passed through his first Gethsemane.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">His decision was greeted with joy at the Deanery.
	Peggy threw her arms round his neck and gave him
	the very first real kiss he had ever received. It revived
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"> </a>him considerably. His Aunt Sophia also embraced
	him. The Dean shook him warmly by the hand,
	and talked eloquent patriotism. Doggie already felt
	a hero. He left the house in a glow, but the drive
	home in the two-seater was cold and the pitch-dark
	night presaged other nights of mercilessness in the
	future; and when Doggie sat alone by his fire, sipping
	the hot milk which Peddle presented him on a silver
	tray, the doubts and fears of the morning racked him
	again. An ignoble possibility occurred to him.
	Murdoch might be wrong. Murdoch might be prejudiced
	by local gossip. Would it not be better to
	go up to London and obtain the opinion of a first-class
	man to whom he was unknown? There was
	also another alternative. Flight. He might go to
	America, and do nothing. To the South of France,
	and help in some sort of way with hospitals for French
	wounded. He caught himself up short as these
	thoughts passed through his mind, and he shuddered.
	He took up the glass of hot milk and put it down
	again. Milk? He needed something stronger. A
	glance in a mirror showed him his sleek hair tousled
	into an upstanding wig. In a kind of horror of himself
	he went to the dining-room and for the first time in
	his life drank a stiff whisky and soda for the sake of
	the stimulant. Reaction came. He felt a man once
	more. Rather suicide at once than such damnable
	dishonour. According to the directions which the
	Dean, a man of affairs, had given him, he sat down
	and wrote his application to the War Office for a
	commission. Then—unique adventure!—he stole
	out of the barred and bolted house, without thought
	of hat and overcoat (let the traducers of alcohol mark
	it well), ran down the drive and posted the letter in
	the box some few yards beyond his entrance gates.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"> </a>The Dean had already posted his letter to his old
	friend General Gadsby at the War Office.</p>

	<p>So the die was cast. The Rubicon was crossed.
	The bridges were burnt. The irrevocable step was
	taken. Dr. Murdoch turned up the next morning
	with his prescription for physical training. And then
	Doggie trained assiduously, monotonously, wearily.
	He grew appalled by the senselessness of this apparently
	unnecessary exertion. Now and then Peggy accompanied
	him on his prescribed walks; but the charm
	of her company was discounted by the glaring superiority
	of her powers of endurance. While he ached with
	fatigue, she pressed along as fresh as Atalanta at the
	beginning of her race. When they parted by the
	Deanery door, she would stand flushed, radiant in
	her youth and health, and say:</p>

	<p>“We’ve had a topping walk, old dear. Now isn’t
	it a glorious thing to feel oneself alive?”</p>

	<p>But poor Doggie of the flabby muscles felt half
	dead.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The fateful letter burdening Doggie with the King’s
	commission arrived a few weeks later: a second
	lieutenancy in a Fusilier battalion of the New Army.
	Dates and instructions were given. The impress of
	the Royal Arms at the head of the paper, with its
	grotesque perky lion and unicorn, conveyed to Doggie
	a sense of the grip of some uncanny power. The typewritten
	words scarcely mattered. The impress fascinated
	him. There was no getting away from it.
	Those two pawing beasts held him in their clutch.
	They headed a Death Warrant, from which there
	was no appeal.</p>

	<p>Doggie put his house in order, dismissed with bounty
	those of his servants who would be no longer needed,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"> </a>and kept the Peddles, husband and wife, to look after
	his interests. On his last night at home he went
	wistfully through the familiar place, the drawing-room
	sacred to his mother’s memory, the dining-room
	so solid in its half-century of comfort, his own peacock
	and ivory room so intensely himself, so expressive of
	his every taste, every mood, every emotion. Those
	strange old-world musical instruments—he could play
	them all with the touch or breath of a master and a
	lover. The old Italian theorbo. He took it up.
	How few to-day knew its melodious secret! He
	looked around. All these daintinesses and prettinesses
	had a meaning. They signified the magical
	little beauties of life—things which asserted a range
	of spiritual truths, none the less real and consolatory
	because vice and crime and ugliness and misery and
	war co-existed in ghastly fact on other facets of the
	planet Earth. The sweetness here expressed was as
	essential to the world’s spiritual life as the sweet
	elements of foodstuffs to its physical life. To the
	getting together of all these articles of beauty he had
	devoted the years of his youth…. And—another
	point of view—was he not the guardian by inheritance—in
	other words, by Divine Providence—of this
	beautiful English home, the trustee of English comfort,
	of the sacred traditions of sweet English life that
	had made England the only country, the only country,
	he thought, that could call itself a Country and not a
	Compromise, in the world?</p>

	<p>And he was going to leave it all. All that it meant
	in beauty and dignity and ease of life. For what?</p>

	<p>For horror and filthiness and ugliness, for everything
	against which his beautiful peacock and ivory
	room protested. Doggie’s last night at Denby Hall
	was a troubled one.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"> </a>Aunt Sophia and Peggy accompanied him to London
	and stayed with him at his stuffy little hotel off Bond
	Street, while Doggie got his kit together. They
	bought everything in every West End shop that any
	salesman assured them was essential for active service.
	Swords, revolvers, field-glasses, pocket-knives (for
	gigantic pockets), compasses, mess-tins, cooking-batteries,
	sleeping-bags, waterproofs, boots innumerable,
	toilet accessories, drinking-cups, thermos flasks,
	field stationery cases, periscopes, tinted glasses, Gieve
	waistcoats, cholera belts, portable medicine cases, earplugs,
	tin-openers, corkscrews, notebooks, pencils,
	luminous watches, electric torches, pins, housewives,
	patent seat walking-sticks—everything that the man
	of commercial instincts had devised for the prosecution
	of the war.</p>

	<p>The amount of warlike equipment with which
	Doggie, with the aid of his Aunt Sophia and Peggy,
	encumbered the narrow little passages of Sturrocks’s
	Hotel, must have weighed about a ton.</p>

	<p>At last Doggie’s uniforms—several suits—came
	home. He had devoted enormous care to their fit.
	Attired in one he looked beautiful. Peggy decreed a
	dinner at the Carlton. She and Doggie alone. Her
	mother could get some stuffy old relation to spend the
	evening with her at Sturrocks’s. She wanted Doggie
	all to herself, so as to realize the dream of many
	disgusting and humiliating months. And as she swept
	through the palm court and up the broad stairs and
	wound through the crowded tables of the restaurant
	with the khaki-clad Doggie by her side, she felt proud
	and uplifted. Here was her soldier whom she had
	made. Her very own man in khaki.</p>

	<p>“Dear old thing,” she whispered, pressing his arm
	as they trekked to their table. “Don’t you feel
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"> </a>glorious? Don’t you feel as if you could face the
	universe?”</p>

	<p>Peggy drank one glass of the quart of champagne.
	Doggie drank the rest.</p>

	<p>On getting into bed he wondered why this unprecedented
	quantity of wine had not affected his
	sobriety. Its only effect had been to stifle thought.
	He went to bed and slept happily, for Peggy’s parting
	kiss had been such as would conduce to any young
	man’s felicity.</p>

	<p>The next morning Aunt Sophia and Peggy saw
	him off to his depot, with his ton of luggage. He
	leaned out of the carriage window and exchanged
	hand kisses with Peggy until the curve of the line cut
	her off. Then he settled down in his corner with the
	<cite>Morning Post</cite>. But he could not concentrate his
	attention on the morning news. This strange costume
	in which he was clothed seemed unreal, monstrous;
	no longer the natty dress in which he had been proud
	to prink the night before, but a nightmare, Nessus-like
	investiture, signifying some abominable burning
	doom.</p>

	<p>The train swept him into a world that was upside

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER VII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Those</span> were proud days for Peggy. She went
	about Durdlebury with her head in the air,
	and her step was as martial as though she herself wore
	the King’s uniform, and she regarded the other girls
	of the town with a defiant eye. If only she could
	discover, she thought, the sender of the abominable
	feather! In Timpany’s drapery establishment she
	raked the girls at the counter with a searching glance.
	At the cathedral services she studied the demure faces
	of her contemporaries. Now that Doggie was a
	soldier she held the anonymous exploit to be cowardly
	and brutal. What did people know of the thousand
	and one reasons that kept eligible young men out of
	the Army? What had they known of Marmaduke?
	As soon as the illusion of his life had been dispelled, he
	had marched away with as gallant a tread as anybody;
	and though Doggie had kept to himself his shrinkings
	and his terrors, she knew that what to the average
	hardily bred young man was a gay adventure, was to
	him an ordeal of considerable difficulty. She longed for
	his first leave, so that she could parade him before the
	town, in the event of there being a lurking sceptic who
	still refused to believe that he had joined the Army.</p>

	<p>Conspicuous in the drawing-room, framed in silver,
	stood a large full-length photograph of Doggie in his
	new uniform.</p>

	<p>She wrote to him daily, chronicling the little doings
	of the town, at times reviling it for its dullness. Dad,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"> </a>on numberless committees, was scarcely ever in the
	house, except for hurried meals. Most of the pleasant
	young clergy had gone. Many of the girls had gone
	too: Dorothy Bruce to be a probationer in a V.A.D.
	hospital. If Durdlebury were not such a rotten out-of-the-world
	place, the infirmary would be full of
	wounded soldiers, and she could do her turn at nursing.
	As things were, she could only knit socks for Tommies
	and a silk khaki tie for her own boy. But when
	everybody was doing their bit, these occupations were
	not enough to prevent her feeling a little slacker.
	He would have to do the patriotic work for both of
	them, tell her all about himself, and let her share
	everything with him in imagination. She also expressed
	her affection for him in shy and slangy terms.</p>

	<p>Doggie wrote regularly. His letters were as shy
	and conveyed less information. The work was hard,
	the hours long, his accommodation Spartan. They
	were in huts on Salisbury Plain. Sometimes he
	confessed himself too tired to write more than a few
	lines. He had a bad cold in the head. He was
	better. They had inoculated him against typhoid and
	had allowed him two or three slack days. The first
	time he had unaccountably fainted; but he had seen
	some of the men do the same, and the doctor had
	assured him that it had nothing to do with cowardice.
	He had gone for a route march and had returned a
	dusty lump of fatigue. But after having shaken the
	dust out of his moustache—Doggie had a playful
	turn of phrase now and then—and drunk a quart
	of shandy-gaff, he had felt refreshed. Then it rained
	hard, and they were all but washed out of the huts.
	It was a very strange life—one which he never dreamed
	could have existed. “Fancy me,” he wrote, “glad
	to sleep on a drenched bed!” There was the riding-school.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"> </a>Why hadn’t he learned to ride as a boy?
	He had been told that the horse was a noble animal
	and the friend of man. He was afraid he would
	return to his dear Peggy with many of his young
	illusions shattered. The horse was the most ignoble,
	malevolent beast that ever walked, except the sergeant-major
	in the riding-school. Peggy was filled with
	admiration for his philosophic endurance of hardships.
	It was real courage. His letters contained simple
	statements of fact, but not a word of complaint. On
	the other hand, they were not ebullient with joy;
	but then, Peggy reflected, there was not much to be
	joyous about in a ramshackle hut on Salisbury Plain.
	“Dear old thing,” she would write, “although you
	don’t grouse, I know you must be having a pretty
	thin time. But you’re bucking up splendidly, and
	when you get your leave I’ll do a girl’s very d——dest
	(don’t be shocked; but I’m sure you’re learning far
	worse language in the Army) to make it up to you.”
	Her heart was very full of him.</p>

	<p>Then there came a time when his letters grew
	rarer and shorter. At last they ceased altogether.
	After a week’s waiting she sent an anxious telegram.
	The answer came back. “Quite well. Will write
	soon.” She waited. He did not write. One evening
	an unstamped envelope, addressed to her in a
	feminine hand, which she recognized as that of Marmaduke’s
	anonymous correspondent, was found in the
	Deanery letter-box. The envelope enclosed a copy
	of a cutting from the “Gazette” of the morning
	paper, and a sentence was underlined and adorned
	with exclamation marks at the sides.</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“R. Fusiliers. Tempy. 2nd Lieutenant J.
	    Trevor resigns his commission.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"> </a>The Colonel dealt with him as gently as he could
	in that final interview. He put his hand in a fatherly
	way on Doggie’s shoulder and bade him not take it
	too much to heart. He had done his best; but he
	was not cut out for an officer. These were merciless
	times. In matters of life and death we could not
	afford weak links in the chain. Soldiers in high
	command, with great reputations, had already been
	scrapped. In Doggie’s case there was no personal
	discredit. He had always conducted himself like a
	gentleman and a man of honour, but he had not the
	qualities necessary for the commanding of men. He
	must send in his resignation.</p>

	<p>“But what can I do, sir?” asked Doggie in a
	choking voice. “I am disgraced for ever.”</p>

	<p>The Colonel reflected for a moment. He knew
	that Doggie’s life had been a little hell on earth from
	the first day he had joined. He was very sorry for
	the poor little toy Pom in his pack of hounds. It
	was scarcely the toy Pom’s fault that he had failed.
	But the Great Hunt could have no use for toy Poms.
	At last he took a sheet of regimental notepaper and
	wrote:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“Dear Trevor,—</p>

		<p>“I am full of admiration for the plucky way in
		which you have striven to overcome your physical
		disabilities, and I am only too sorry that they should
		have compelled the resignation of your commission
		and your severance from the regiment.</p>

		<p class="signature">“Yours sincerely,<br />
		“<span class="name">L. G. Caird</span>,<br />
		“Lt-Col.”</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>He handed it to Doggie.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"> </a>“That’s all I can do for you, my poor boy,” said he.</p>

	<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Doggie.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Doggie took a room at the Savoy Hotel, and sat
	there most of the day, the pulp of a man. He had
	gone to the Savoy, not daring to show his face at the
	familiar Sturrocks’s. At the Savoy he was but a
	number unknown, unquestioned. He wore civilian
	clothes. Such of his uniforms and martial paraphernalia
	as he had been allowed to retain in camp—for
	one can’t house a ton of kit in a hut—he had given to
	his batman. His one desire now was to escape from
	the eyes of his fellow-men. He felt that he bore
	upon him the stigma of his disgrace, obvious to any
	casual glance. He was the man who had been turned
	out of the army as a hopeless incompetent. Even
	worse than the slacker—for the slacker might have
	latent the qualities that he lacked. Even at the best
	and brightest, he could only be mistaken for a slacker,
	once more the likely recipient of white feathers from
	any damsel patriotically indiscreet. The Colonel’s
	letter brought him little consolation. It is true that
	he carried it about with him in his pocket-book;
	but the gibing eyes of observers had not the X-ray
	power to read it there. And he could not pin it on
	his hat. Besides, he knew that the kindly Colonel
	had stretched a point of veracity. No longer could
	he take refuge in his cherished delicacy of constitution.
	It would be a lie.</p>

	<p>Peggy, in her softest and most pitying mood, never
	guessed the nature of Doggie’s ordeal. Those letters
	so brave, sometimes so playful, had been written with
	shaky hand, misty eyes, throbbing head, despairing
	heart. Looking back, it seemed to him one blurred
	dream of pain. His brother officers were no worse
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"> </a>than those in any other Kitchener regiment. Indeed,
	the Colonel was immensely proud of them and sang
	their praises to any fellow-dugout who would listen
	to him at the Naval and Military Club. But how
	were a crowd of young men, trained in the rough and
	tumble of public schools, universities and sport, and
	now throbbing under the stress of the new deadly
	game, to understand poor Doggie Trevor? They
	had no time to take him seriously, save to curse him
	when he did wrong, and in their leisure time he became
	naturally a butt for their amusement.</p>

	<p>“Surely I don’t have to sleep in there?” he asked
	the subaltern who was taking him round on the day
	of his arrival in camp, and showed him his squalid
	little cubby-hole of a hut with its dirty boards, its
	cheap table and chair, its narrow sleep-dispelling little
	bedstead.</p>

	<p>“Yes, it’s a beastly hole, isn’t it? Until last month
	we were under canvas.”</p>

	<p>“Sleeping on the bare ground?”</p>

	<p>“Wallowing in the mud like pigs. Not one of us
	without a cold. Never had a such filthy time in my
	life.”</p>

	<p>Doggie looked about him helplessly, while the
	comforter smiled grimly. Already his disconsolate
	attitude towards the dingy hutments of the camp and
	the layer of thick mud on his beautiful new boots
	had diverted his companion.</p>

	<p>“Couldn’t I have this furnished at my own
	expense? A carpet and a proper bed, and a few
	pictures——”</p>

	<p>“I wouldn’t try.”</p>

	<p>“Why not?”</p>

	<p>“Some of it might get broken—not quite accidentally.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"> </a>“But surely,” gasped Doggie, “the soldiers would
	not be allowed to come in here and touch my furniture?”</p>

	<p>“It seems,” said the subaltern, after a bewildered
	stare, “that you have quite a lot to learn.”</p>

	<p>Doggie had. The subaltern reported a new kind
	of animal to the mess. The mess saw to it that Doggie
	should be crammed with information—but information
	wholly incorrect and misleading, which added to
	his many difficulties. When his ton of kit arrived
	he held an unwilling reception in the hut and found
	himself obliged to explain to gravely curious men the
	use for which the various articles were designed.</p>

	<p>“This, I suppose, is a new type of gas-mask?”</p>

	<p>No. It was a patent cooker. Doggie politely
	showed how it worked. He also demonstrated that a
	sleeping-bag was not a kit-sack of a size unauthorized
	by the regulations, and that a huge steel-pointed walking-stick
	had nothing to do with agriculture.</p>

	<p>He was very weary of his visitors by the time they
	had gone. The next day the Adjutant advised him
	to scrap the lot. So sorrowfully he sent back most
	of his purchases to London.</p>

	<p>Then the Imp of Mischance brought as a visitor
	to the mess, a subaltern from another regiment who
	belonged to Doggie’s part of the country.</p>

	<p>“Why—I’m blowed if it isn’t Doggie Trevor!”
	he exclaimed carelessly. “How d’ye do, Doggie?”</p>

	<p>So thenceforward he was known in the regiment
	by the hated name.</p>

	<p>There were rags in which, as he was often the
	victim, he was forced to join. His fastidiousness
	loathed the coarse personal contact of arms and legs
	and bodies. His undeveloped strength could not cope
	with the muscle of his young brother barbarians.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"> </a>Aching with the day’s fatigue, he would plead, to
	no avail, to be left alone. Compared with these feared
	and detested scraps, he considered, in after-times,
	battles to be agreeable recreations.</p>

	<p>Had he been otherwise competent, he might have
	won through the teasing and the ragging of the mess.
	No one disliked him. He was pleasant-mannered,
	good-natured, and appeared to bear no malice. True,
	his ignorance not only of the ways of the army but
	of the ways of their old hearty world, was colossal,
	his mode of expression rather that of a precise old
	church dignitary than of a subaltern in a regiment
	of Fusiliers, his habits, including a nervous shrinking
	from untidiness and dirt, those of a dear old maid;
	but the mess thought, honestly, that he could be
	knocked into their own social shape, and in the process
	of knocking carried out their own traditions. They
	might have succeeded if Doggie had discovered any
	reserve source of pride from which to draw. But
	Doggie was hopeless at his work. The mechanism
	of a rifle filled him with dismay. He could not help
	shutting his eyes before he pulled the trigger. Inured
	all his life to lethargic action, he found the smart crisp
	movements of drill almost impossible to attain. The
	riding-school was a terror and a torture. Every
	second he deemed himself in imminent peril of death.
	Said the sergeant-major:</p>

	<p>“Now, Mr. Trevor, you’re sitting on a ’orse and
	not a ’olly-bush.”</p>

	<p>And Doggie would wish the horse and the sergeant-major
	in hell.</p>

	<p>Again, what notion could poor Doggie have of
	command? He had never raised his mild tenor voice
	to damn anybody in his life. At first the tone in
	which the officers ordered the men about shocked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"> </a>him. So rough, so unmannerly, so unkind. He
	could not understand the cheery lack of resentment
	with which the men obeyed. He could not get into
	the way of military directness, could never check the
	polite “Do you mind” that came instinctively to his
	lips. Now if you ask a private soldier whether he
	minds doing a thing instead of telling him to do it,
	his brain begins to get confused. As one defaulter,
	whose confusion of brain had led him into trouble,
	observed to his mates: “What can you do with a
	blighter who’s a cross between a blinking Archbishop
	and a ruddy dicky-bird?” What else, save show in
	divers and ingenious ways that you mocked at his
	authority? Doggie had the nervous dread of the
	men that he had anticipated. During his training
	on parade, words of command stuck in his throat.
	When forced out, they grotesquely mixed themselves
	together.</p>

	<p>The Adjutant gave advice.</p>

	<p>“Speak out, man. Bawl. You’re dealing with
	soldiers at drill, not saying sweet nothings to old
	ladies in a drawing-room.”</p>

	<p>And Doggie tried. Doggie tried very hard. He
	was mortified by his own stupidity. Little points of
	drill and duty that the others of his own standing
	seemed to pick up at once, almost by instinct, he could
	only grasp after long and tedious toil. No one realized
	that his brain was stupefied by the awful and unaccustomed
	physical fatigue.</p>

	<p>And then came the inevitable end.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">So Doggie crept into the Savoy Hotel and hid
	himself there, wishing he were dead. It was some
	time before he could write the terrible letter to Peggy.
	He did so on the day when he saw that his resignation
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"> </a>was gazetted. He wrote after many anguished
	attempts:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“Dear Peggy,—</p>

		<p>“I haven’t written before about the dreadful
		thing that has happened, because I simply couldn’t.
		I have resigned my commission. Not of my own free
		will, for, believe me, I would have gone through
		anything for your sake, to say nothing of the country
		and my own self-respect. To put it brutally, I have
		been thrown out for sheer incompetence.</p>

		<p>“I neither hope nor expect nor want you to continue
		your engagement to a disgraced man. I release
		you from every obligation your pity and generosity
		may think binding. I want you to forget me and
		marry a man who can do the work of this new world.</p>

		<p>“What I shall do I don’t know. I have scarcely
		yet been able to think. Possibly I shall go abroad.
		At any rate I shan’t return to Durdlebury. If women
		sent me white feathers before I joined, what would
		they send me now? It will always be my consolation
		to know that you once gave me your love, in spite
		of the pain of realizing that I have forfeited it by
		my unworthiness.</p>

		<p>“Please tell Uncle Edward that I feel keenly his
		position, for he was responsible for getting me the
		commission through General Gadsby. Give my love
		to my Aunt, if she will have it.</p>

		<p class="signature">“Yours always affectionately,<br />
		<span class="name">J. Marmaduke Trevor</span>.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>By return of post came the answer:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“Dearest,—</p>

		<p>“We are all desperately disappointed. Perhaps
		we hurried on things too quickly and tried you too
		<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"> </a>high all at once. I ought to have known. Oh, my
		poor dear boy, you must have had a dreadful time.
		Why didn’t you tell me? The news in the ‘Gazette’
		came upon me like a thunderbolt. I didn’t know
		what to think. I’m afraid I thought the worst, the
		very horrid worst—that you had got tired of it and
		resigned of your own accord. How was one to know?
		Your letter was almost a relief.</p>

		<p>“In offering to release me from my engagement
		you are acting like the honourable gentleman you are.
		Of course, I can understand your feelings. But I
		should be a little beast to accept right away like that.
		If there are any feathers about, I should deserve to
		have them stuck on to me with tar. Don’t think of
		going abroad or doing anything foolish, dear, like that,
		till you have seen me—that is to say, us, for Dad is
		bringing Mother and me up to town by the first train
		to-morrow. Dad feels sure that everything is not
		lost. He’ll dig out General Gadsby and fix up something
		for you. In the meantime, get us rooms at the
		Savoy, though Mother is worried as to whether it’s
		a respectable place for Deans to stay at. But I know
		you wouldn’t like to meet us at Sturrocks’s—otherwise
		you would have been there yourself. Meet our train.
		All love from</p>

		<p class="signature">“<span class="name">Peggy</span>.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Doggie engaged the rooms, but he did not meet the
	train. He did not even stay in the hotel to meet his
	relations. He could not meet them. He could not
	meet the pity in their eyes. He read in Peggy’s note
	a desire to pet and soothe him and call him “Poor
	little Doggie,” and he writhed. He could not even
	take up an heroic attitude, and say to Peggy: “When
	I have retrieved the past and can bring you an unsullied
	<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"> </a>reputation, I will return and claim you. Till then
	farewell.” There was no retrieving the past. Other
	men might fail at first, and then make good; but he
	was not like them. His was the fall of Humpty
	Dumpty. Final—irretrievable.</p>

	<p>He packed up his things in a fright and, leaving no
	address at the Savoy, drove to the Russell Hotel in
	Bloomsbury. But he wrote Peggy a letter “to await
	arrival.” If time had permitted he would have sent
	a telegram, stating that he was off for Tobolsk or
	Tierra del Fuego, and thereby prevented their useless
	journey; but they had already started when he
	received Peggy’s message.</p>

	<p>Nothing could be done, he wrote, in effect, to her,
	nothing in the way of redemption. He would not
	put her father to the risk of any other such humiliation.
	He had learned, by the most bitter experience, that
	the men who counted now in the world’s respect and
	in woman’s love were men of a type to which, with
	all the goodwill in the world, he could not make
	himself belong—he did not say to which he wished
	he could belong with all the agony and yearning of
	his soul. Peggy must forget him. The only thing
	he could do was to act up to her generous estimate
	of him as an honourable gentleman. As such it was
	his duty to withdraw for ever from her life. His
	exact words, however, were: “You know how I
	have always hated slang, how it has jarred upon me,
	often to your amusement, when you have used it.
	But I have learned in the past months how expressive
	it may be. Through slang I’ve learned what I am.
	I am a born ‘rotter.’ A girl like you can’t possibly
	love and marry a rotter. So the rotter, having a
	lingering sense of decency, makes his bow and exits—God
	knows where.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"> </a>Peggy, red-eyed, adrift, rudderless on a frightening
	sea, called her father into her bedroom at the Savoy
	and showed him the letter. He drew out and adjusted
	his round tortoise-shell-rimmed reading-glasses and
	read it.</p>

	<p>“That’s a miraculously new Doggie,” said he.</p>

	<p>Peggy clutched the edges of his coat.</p>

	<p>“I’ve never heard you call him that before.”</p>

	<p>“It has never been worth while,” said the Dean.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_VIII"><a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">At</span> the Savoy, during the first stupefaction of his
	misery, Doggie had not noticed particularly
	the prevalence of khaki. At the Russell it dwelt
	insistent, like the mud on Salisbury Plain. Men that
	might have been the twin brethren of his late brother
	officers were everywhere, free, careless, efficient. The
	sight of them added the gnaw of envy to his heartache.
	Even in his bedroom he could hear the jingle of their
	spurs and their cheery voices as they clanked along
	the corridor. On the third day after his migration
	he took a bold step and moved into lodgings in Woburn
	Place. Here at least he could find quiet, untroubled
	by heart-rending sights and sounds. He spent most
	of his time in dull reading and dispirited walking.
	For he could walk now—so much had his training
	done for him—and walk for many miles without
	fatigue. For all the enjoyment he got out of it, he
	might as well have marched round a prison yard.
	Indeed there were some who tramped the prison
	yards with keener zest. They were buoyed up with
	the hope of freedom, they could look forward to the
	ever-approaching day when they should be thrown
	once more into the glad whirl of life. But the miraculously
	new Doggie had no hope. He felt for ever
	imprisoned in his shame. His failure preyed on his
	mind.</p>

	<p>He dallied with thoughts of suicide. Why hadn’t
	he salved, at any rate, his service revolver? Then he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"> </a>remembered the ugly habits of the unmanageable thing—how
	it always kicked its muzzle up in the air.
	Would he have been able even to shoot himself with
	it? And he smiled in self-derision. Drowning was
	not so difficult. Any fool could throw himself into
	the water. With a view to the inspection of a suitable
	spot, Doggie wandered, idly, in the dusk of one evening,
	to Waterloo Bridge, and turning his back to the ceaseless
	traffic, leaned his elbows on the parapet and stared
	in front of him. A few lights already gleamed from
	Somerset House and the more dimly seen buildings
	of the Temple. The dome of St. Paul’s loomed a
	dark shadow through the mist. The river stretched
	below very peaceful, very inviting. The parapet
	would be easy to climb. He did not know whether
	he could dive in the approved manner—hands joined
	over head. He had never learned to swim, let alone
	dive. At any rate, he could fall off. In that art
	the riding-school had proved him a past master. But
	the spot had its disadvantages. It was too public.
	Perhaps other bridges might afford more privacy. He
	would inspect them all. It would be something to
	do. There was no hurry. As he was not wanted in
	this world, so he had no assurance of being welcome
	in the next. He had a morbid vision of avatar after
	avatar being kicked from sphere to sphere.</p>

	<p>At this point of his reflections he became aware of
	a presence by his side. He turned his head and found
	a soldier, an ordinary private, very close to him, also
	leaning on the parapet.</p>

	<p>“I thought I wasn’t mistaken in Mr. Marmaduke
	Trevor.”</p>

	<p>Doggie started away, on the point of flight, dreading
	the possible insolence of one of the men of his late
	regiment. But the voice of the speaker rang in his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"> </a>ears with a strange familiarity, and the great fleshy
	nose, the high cheek-bones, and the little grey eyes in
	the weather-beaten face suggested vaguely some one
	of the long ago. His dawning recognition amused
	the soldier.</p>

	<p>“Yes, laddie. Ye’re right. It’s your old Phineas—Phineas
	McPhail, Esq., M.A., defunct. Now 33702
	Private P. McPhail redivivus.”</p>

	<p>He warmly wrung the hand of the semi-bewildered
	Doggie, who murmured: “Very glad to meet you,
	I’m sure.”</p>

	<p>Phineas, gaunt and bony, took his arm.</p>

	<p>“Would it not just be possible,” he said, in his old
	half-pedantic, half-ironic intonation, “to find a locality
	less exposed to the roar of traffic and the rude jostling
	of pedestrians and the inclemency of the elements,
	in which we can enjoy the amenities of a little refined
	conversation?”</p>

	<p>It was like a breath from the past. Doggie smiled.</p>

	<p>“Which way are you going?”</p>

	<p>“Your way, my dear Marmaduke, was ever mine,
	until I was swept, I thought for ever, out of your path
	by a torrential spate of whisky.”</p>

	<p>He laughed, as though it had been a playful freak
	of destiny. Doggie laughed, too. But for the words
	he had addressed to hotel and lodging-house folk, he
	had spoken to no one for over a fortnight. The
	instinctive craving for companionship made Phineas
	suddenly welcome.</p>

	<p>“Yes. Let us have a talk,” said he. “Come to
	my rooms, if you have the time. There’ll be some
	dinner.”</p>

	<p>“Will I come? Will I have dinner? Will I
	re-enter once more the paradise of the affluent?
	Laddie, I will.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"> </a>In the Strand they hailed a taxi and drove to Bloomsbury.
	On the way Phineas asked:</p>

	<p>“You mentioned your rooms. Are you residing
	permanently in London?”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“And Durdlebury?”</p>

	<p>“I’m not going back.”</p>

	<p>“London’s a place full of temptations for those
	without experience,” Phineas observed sagely.</p>

	<p>“I’ve not noticed any,” Doggie replied. On which
	Phineas laughed and slapped him on the knee.</p>

	<p>“Man,” said he, “when I first saw you I thought
	you had changed into a disillusioned misanthropist.
	But I’m wrong. You haven’t changed a bit.”</p>

	<p>A few minutes later they reached Woburn Place.
	Doggie showed him into the sitting-room on the
	drawing-room floor. A fire was burning in the grate,
	for though it was only early autumn, the evening was
	cold. The table was set for Doggie’s dinner. Phineas
	looked round him in surprise. The heterogeneous
	and tasteless furniture, the dreadful Mid-Victorian
	prints on the walls—one was the “Return of the
	Guards from the Crimea,” representing the landing
	from the troop-ship, repellent in its smug unreality,
	the coarse glass and well-used plate on the table, the
	crumpled napkin in a ring (for Marmaduke who in
	his mother’s house had never been taught to dream that
	a napkin could possibly be used for two consecutive
	meals!), the general air of slipshod Philistinism—all
	came as a shock to Phineas, who had expected to find
	in Marmaduke’s “rooms” a replica of the fastidious
	prettiness of the peacock and ivory room at Denby
	Hall. He scratched his head, covered with a thick
	brown thatch.</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said he gravely, “you must excuse me
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"> </a>if I take a liberty; but I canna fit you into this
	environment.”</p>

	<p>Doggie looked about him also. “Seems funny,
	doesn’t it?”</p>

	<p>“It cannot be that you’ve come down in the
	world?”</p>

	<p>“To bed-rock,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“No?” said Phineas, with an air of concern.
	“Man, I’m awful sorry. I know what the coming
	down feels like. And I, finding it not abhorrent to
	a sophisticated and well-trained conscience, and thinking
	you could well afford it, extracted a thousand pounds
	from your fortune. My dear lad, if Phineas McPhail
	could return the money——”</p>

	<p>Doggie broke in with a laugh. “Pray don’t distress
	yourself, Phineas. It’s not a question of money. I’ve
	as much as ever I had. The last thing in the world
	I’ve had to think of has been money.”</p>

	<p>“Then what in the holy names of Thunder and
	Beauty,” cried Phineas, throwing out one hand to an
	ancient saddle-bag sofa whose ends were covered by
	flimsy rags, and the other to the decayed ormolu clock
	on the mantelpiece, “what in the name of common
	sense are you doing in this awful inelegant lodging-house?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know,” replied Doggie. “It’s a fact,”
	he continued after a pause. “The scheme of decoration
	is revolting to every æsthetic sense which I’ve
	spent my life in cultivating. Its futile pretentiousness
	is the rasping irritation of every hour. Yet here I am.
	Quite comfortable. And here I propose to stay.”</p>

	<p>Phineas McPhail, M.A., late of Glasgow and Cambridge,
	looked at Doggie with his keen little grey eyes
	beneath bent and bristling eyebrows. In the language
	of 33702 Private McPhail, he asked:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"> </a>“What the blazes is it all about?”</p>

	<p>“That’s a long story,” said Doggie, looking at
	his watch. “In the meantime, I had better give
	some orders about dinner. And you would like to
	wash.”</p>

	<p>He threw open a wing of the folding-doors, once
	in Georgian times separating drawing-room from withdrawing-room,
	and now separating living-room from
	bedroom, and switching on the light, invited McPhail
	to follow.</p>

	<p>“I think you’ll find everything you want,” said he.</p>

	<p>Phineas McPhail, left alone to his ablutions, again
	looked round, and he had more reason than ever to
	ask what it was all about. Marmaduke’s bedroom
	at Denby Hall had been a dream of satinwood and
	dull blue silk. The furniture and hangings had been
	Mrs. Trevor’s present to Marmaduke on his sixteenth
	birthday. He remembered how he had been bored
	to death by that stupendous ass of an old woman—for
	so he had characterized her—during the process of
	selection and installation. The present room, although
	far more luxurious than any that Phineas McPhail
	had slept in for years, formed a striking contrast with
	that remembered nest of effeminacy.</p>

	<p>“I’ll have to give it up,” he said to himself. But
	just as he had put the finishing touches to his hair an
	idea occurred to him. He flung open the door.</p>

	<p>“Laddie, I’ve got it. It’s a woman.”</p>

	<p>But Doggie laughed and shook his head, and leaving
	McPhail, took his turn in the bedroom. For the
	first time since his return to civil life he ceased for a
	few moments to brood over his troubles. McPhail’s
	mystification amused him. McPhail’s personality and
	address, viewed in the light of the past, were full of
	interest. Obviously he was a man who lived unashamed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"> </a>on low levels. Doggie wondered how he
	could have regarded him for years with a respect
	almost amounting to veneration. In a curious
	unformulated way Doggie felt that he had authority
	over this man so much older than himself, who had
	once been his master. It tickled into some kind of
	life his deadened self-esteem. Here at last was a
	man with whom he could converse on sure ground.
	The khaki uniform caused him no envy.</p>

	<p>“The poet is not altogether incorrect,” said McPhail,
	when they sat down to dinner, “in pointing out
	the sweet uses of adversity. If it had not been for the
	adversity of a wee bit operation, I should not now be
	on sick furlough. And if I had not been on furlough
	I shouldn’t have the pleasure of this agreeable reconciliation.
	Here’s to you, laddie, and to our lasting
	friendship.” He sipped his claret. “It’s not like
	the Lafitte in the old cellar—<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eheu fugaces anni et</em>—what
	the plague is the Latin for vintages? But
	’twill serve.” He drank again and smacked his
	lips. “It will even serve very satisfactorily. Good
	wine at a perfect temperature is not the daily drink
	of the British soldier.”</p>

	<p>“By the way,” said Doggie, “you haven’t told
	me why you became a soldier.”</p>

	<p>“A series of vicissitudes dating from the hour I
	left your house,” said Phineas, “vicissitudes the recital
	of which would wring your heart, laddie, and make
	angels weep if their lachrymal glands were not too
	busily engaged by the horrors of war, culminated
	four months ago in an attack of fervid and penniless
	patriotism. No one seemed to want me except my
	country. She clamoured for me on every hoarding
	and every omnibus. A recruiting-sergeant in Trafalgar
	Square tapped me on the arm, and said: ‘Young
	<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"> </a>man, your country wants you.’ Said I with my
	Scottish caution, ‘Can you take your affidavit that
	you got the information straight from the War Office?’
	‘I can,’ said he. Then I threw myself on his bosom
	and bade him take me to her. That’s how I became
	33702 Private Phineas McPhail, A Company, 10th
	Wessex Rangers, at the remuneration of one shilling
	and twopence per diem.”</p>

	<p>“Do you like it?” asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>Phineas rubbed the side of his thick nose thoughtfully.</p>

	<p>“There you come to the metaphysical conception
	of human happiness,” he replied. “In itself it is a
	vile life. To a man of thirty-five——”</p>

	<p>“Good lord!” cried Doggie, “I always thought
	you were about fifty!”</p>

	<p>“Your mother caught me young, laddie. To a
	man of thirty-five, a graduate of ancient and honourable
	universities and a whilom candidate for holy
	orders, it is a life that would seem to have no attraction
	whatever. The hours are absurd, the work distasteful,
	and the mode of living repulsive. But strange to say,
	it fully contents me. The secret of happiness lies in
	the supple adaptability to conditions. When I found
	that it was necessary to perform ridiculous antics with
	my legs and arms, I entered into the comicality of the
	idea and performed them with an indulgent zest which
	soon won me the precious encomiums of my superiors
	in rank. When I found that the language of the
	canteen was not that of the pulpit or the drawing-room,
	I quickly acquired the new vocabulary and won the
	pleasant esteem of my equals. By means of this faculty
	of adaptability I can suck enjoyment out of everything.
	But, at the same time, mind you, keeping in reserve a
	little secret fount of pleasure.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"> </a>“What do you call a little secret fount of pleasure?”
	asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>“I’ll give you an illustration—and, if you’re the
	man I consider you to be, you’ll take a humorous view
	of my frankness. At present I adapt myself to a rough
	atmosphere of coarseness and lustiness, in which
	nothing coarse or lusty I could do would produce
	the slightest ripple of a convulsion: but I have my
	store of a cultivated mind and cheap editions of the
	classics, my little secret fount of Castaly to drink from
	whenever I so please. On the other hand, when I
	had the honour of being responsible for your education,
	I adapted myself to a hot-house atmosphere in which
	Respectability and the concomitant virtues of Supineness
	and Sloth were cultivated like rare orchids; but
	in my bedroom I kept a secret fount which had its
	source in some good Scots distillery.”</p>

	<p>Whereupon he attacked his plateful of chicken
	with vehement gusto.</p>

	<p>“You’re a hedonist, Phineas,” said Doggie, after
	a thoughtful pause.</p>

	<p>“Man,” said Phineas, laying down his knife and
	fork, “you’ve just hit it. I am. I’m an accomplished
	hedonist. An early recognition of the fact
	saved me from the Church.”</p>

	<p>“And the Church from you,” said Doggie quietly.</p>

	<p>Phineas shot a swift glance at him beneath his
	shaggy brown eyebrows.</p>

	<p>“Ay,” said he. “Though, mark you, if I had
	followed my original vocation, the Bench of Bishops
	could not have surpassed me in the unction in which
	I would have wallowed. If I had been born a bee in
	a desert, laddie, I would have sucked honey out of a
	dead camel.”</p>

	<p>With easy and picturesque cynicism, and in a Glasgow
	<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"> </a>accent which had curiously broadened since his
	spell of Oriental ease at Denby Hall, he developed his
	philosophy, illustrating it by incidents more or less
	reputable in his later career. At first, possessor of the
	ill-gotten thousand pounds and of considerable savings
	from a substantial salary, he had enjoyed the short
	wild riot of the Prodigal’s life. Paris saw most of his
	money—the Paris which, under his auspices, Doggie
	never knew. Plentiful claret set his tongue wagging
	in Rabelaisian reminiscence. After Paris came husks.
	Not bad husks if you knew how to cook them. Borrowed
	salt and pepper and a little stolen butter worked
	wonders. But they were irritating to the stomach.
	He lay on the floor, said he, and yelled for fatted
	calf; but there was no soft-headed parent to supply
	it. Phineas McPhail must be a slave again and work
	for his living. Then came private coaching, freelance
	journalism, hunting for secretaryships: the commonplace
	story humorously told of the wastrel’s
	decline; then a gorgeous efflorescence in light green
	and gold as the man outside a picture palace in Camberwell—and
	lastly, the penniless patriot throwing himself
	into the arms of his desirous country.</p>

	<p>“Have you any whisky in the house, laddie?”
	he asked, after the dinner things had been taken away.</p>

	<p>“No,” said Doggie, “but I could easily get you
	some.”</p>

	<p>“Pray don’t,” said McPhail. “If you had, I
	was going to ask you to be kind enough not to let
	your excellent landlord, whom I recognize as a butler
	of the old school, produce it. Butlers of the old school
	are apt, like Peddle, to bring in a maddening tray of
	decanters, syphons, and glasses. You may not believe
	me, but I haven’t touched a drop of whisky since I
	joined the army.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"> </a>“Why?” asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>McPhail looked at the long carefully preserved
	ash of one of Doggie’s excellent cigars.</p>

	<p>“It’s all a part of the doctrine of adaptability. In
	order to attain happiness in the army, the first step is to
	avoid differences of opinion with the civil and military
	police and non-commissioned officers, and such-like
	sycophantic myrmidons of authority. Being a man of
	academic education, it is with difficulty that I agree
	with them when I’m sober. If I were drunk, my
	bonnie laddie”—he waved a hand—“well—I don’t
	get drunk. And as I have no use for whisky, as merely
	an agreeable beverage, I have struck whisky out of my
	hedonistic scheme of existence. But if you have any
	more of that pleasant claret——”</p>

	<p>Doggie rang the bell and gave the order. The
	landlord brought in bottle and glasses.</p>

	<p>“And now, my dear Marmaduke,” said Phineas
	after an appreciative sip, “now that I have told you
	the story of my life, may I, without impertinent
	curiosity, again ask you what you meant when you
	said you had come down to bed-rock?”</p>

	<p>The sight of the man, smug, cynical, shameless,
	sprawling luxuriously on the sofa, with his tunic
	unbuttoned, filled him with sudden fury: such fury
	as Oliver’s insult had aroused, such as had impelled
	him during a vicious rag in the mess to clutch a man’s
	hair and almost pull it out by the roots.</p>

	<p>“Yes, you may; and I’ll tell you,” he cried, starting
	to his feet. “I’ve reached the bed-rock of myself—the
	bed-rock of humiliation and disgrace. And it’s
	all your fault. Instead of training me to be a man,
	you pandered to my poor mother’s weaknesses and
	brought me up like a little toy dog—the infernal name
	still sticks to me wherever I go. You made a helpless
	<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"> </a>fool of me, and let me go out a helpless fool into the
	world. And when you came across me I was thinking
	whether it wouldn’t be best to throw myself over the
	parapet. A month ago you would have saluted me
	in the street and stood before me at attention when I
	spoke to you——”</p>

	<p>“Eh? What’s that, laddie?” interrupted Phineas,
	sitting up. “You’ve held a commission in the
	army?”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” said Doggie fiercely, “and I’ve been
	chucked. I’ve been thrown out as a hopeless rotter.
	And who is most to blame—you or I? It’s you.
	You’ve brought me to this infernal place. I’m here
	in hiding—hiding from my family and the decent
	folk I’m ashamed to meet. And it’s all your fault,
	and now you have it!”</p>

	<p>“Laddie, laddie,” said Phineas reproachfully, “the
	facts of my being a guest beneath your roof and my
	humble military rank, render it difficult for me to make
	an appropriate reply.”</p>

	<p>Doggie’s rage had spent itself. These rare fits were
	short-lived and left him somewhat unnerved.</p>

	<p>“I’m sorry, Phineas. As you say, you’re my
	guest. And as to your uniform, God knows I honour
	every man who wears it.”</p>

	<p>“That’s taking things in the right spirit,” Phineas
	conceded graciously, helping himself to another glass
	of wine. “And the right spirit is a great healer of
	differences. I’ll not go so far as to deny that there is
	an element of justice in your apportionment of blame.
	There may, on various occasions, have been some small
	dereliction of duty. But you’ll have been observing
	that in the recent exposition of my philosophy I have
	not laboured the point of duty to disproportionate
	exaggeration.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"> </a>Doggie lit a cigarette. His fingers were still
	shaking. “I’m glad you own up. It’s a sign of
	grace.”</p>

	<p>“Ay,” said Phineas, “no man is altogether bad.
	In spite of everything, I’ve always entertained a warm
	affection for you, laddie, and when I saw you staring
	at bogies round about the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral
	my heart went out to you. You didn’t look over-happy.”</p>

	<p>Doggie, always responsive to human kindness,
	was touched. He felt a note of sincerity in McPhail’s
	tone. Perhaps he had judged him harshly, overlooking
	the plea in extenuation which Phineas had set
	up—that in every man there must be some saving
	remnant of goodness.</p>

	<p>“I wasn’t happy, Phineas,” he said; “I was as
	miserable an outcast as could be found in London,
	and when a fellow’s down and out, you must forgive
	him for speaking more bitterly than he ought.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t I know, laddie? Don’t I know?” said
	Phineas sympathetically. He reached for the cigar-box.
	“Do you mind if I take another? Perhaps
	two—one to smoke afterwards, in memory of this
	meeting. It is a long time since my lips touched a
	thing so gracious as a real Havana.”</p>

	<p>“Take a lot,” said Doggie generously, “I don’t
	really like cigars. I only bought them because I
	thought they might be stronger than cigarettes.”</p>

	<p>Phineas filled his pockets. “You can pay no greater
	compliment to a man’s honesty of purpose,” said he,
	“than by taking him at his word. And now,” he
	continued, when he had carefully lit the cigar he had
	first chosen, “let us review the entire situation. What
	about our good friends at Durdlebury? What about
	your uncle, the Very Reverend the Dean, against
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"> </a>whom I bear no ill-will, though I do not say that his
	ultimate treatment of me was not over-hasty—what
	about him? If you call upon me to put my almost
	fantastically variegated experience of life at your
	disposal, and advise you in this crisis, so I must ask you
	to let me know the exact conditions in which you find
	yourself.”</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled once again, finding something diverting
	and yet stimulating in the calm assurance of Private
	McPhail.</p>

	<p>“I’m not aware that I’ve asked you for advice,
	Phineas.”</p>

	<p>“The fact that you’re not aware of many things
	that you do is no proof that you don’t do them—and
	do them in a manner perfectly obvious to another
	party,” replied Phineas sententiously. “You’re asking
	for advice and consolation from any friendly human
	creature to whom you’re not ashamed to speak. You’ve
	had an awful sorrowful time, laddie.”</p>

	<p>Doggie roamed about the room, with McPhail’s
	little grey eyes fixed on him. Yes, Phineas was
	right. He would have given most of his possessions
	to be able, these later days, to pour out his tortured
	soul into sympathetic ears. But shame had kept him,
	still kept him, would always keep him, from the ears of
	those he loved. Yes, Phineas had said the diabolically
	right thing. He could not be ashamed to speak to
	Phineas. And there was something good in Phineas
	which he had noticed with surprise. How easy for
	him, in response to bitter accusation, to cast the blame
	on his mother? He himself had given the opening.
	How easy for him to point to his predecessor’s short
	tenure of office and plead the alternative of carrying
	out Mrs. Trevor’s theory of education or of resigning
	his position in favour of some sycophant even more
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"> </a>time-serving? But he had kept silent…. Doggie
	stopped short and looked at Phineas with eyes dumbly
	questioning and quivering lips.</p>

	<p>Phineas rose and put his hands on the boy’s shoulders,
	and said very gently:</p>

	<p>“Tell me all about it, laddie.”</p>

	<p>Then Doggie broke down, and with a gush of
	unminded tears found expression for his stony despair.
	His story took a long time in the telling; and Phineas
	interjecting an occasional sympathetic “Ay, ay,”
	and a delicately hinted question, extracted from Doggie
	all there was to tell, from the outbreak of war to their
	meeting on Waterloo Bridge.</p>

	<p>“And now,” cried he at last, a dismally tragic
	figure, his young face distorted and reddened, his sleek
	hair ruffled from the back into unsightly perpendicularities
	(an invariable sign of distracted emotion)
	and his hands appealingly outstretched—“what the
	hell am I going to do?”</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said Phineas, standing on the hearthrug,
	his hands on his hips, “if you had posed the question
	in the polite language of the precincts of Durdlebury
	Cathedral, I might have been at a loss to reply. But
	the manly invocation of hell shows me that your foot
	is already on the upward path. If you had prefaced
	it by the adjective that gives colour to all the aspirations
	of the British Army, it would have been better. But
	I’m not reproaching you, laddie. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poco à poco.</em> It
	is enough. It shows me you are not going to run away
	to a neutral country and present the unedifying spectacle
	of a mangy little British lion at the mercy
	of a menagerie of healthy hyenas and such-like
	inferior though truculent beasties.”</p>

	<p>“My God!” cried Doggie, “haven’t I thought
	of it till I’m half mad? It would be just as you say—unendurable.”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a>He began to pace the room again.
	“And I can’t go to France. It would be just the
	same as England. Every one would be looking white
	feathers at me. The only thing I can do is to go out
	of the world. I’m not fit for it. Oh, I don’t mean
	suicide. I’ve not enough pluck. That’s off. But
	I could go and bury myself in the wilderness somewhere
	where no one would ever find me.”</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said McPhail, “I misdoubt that you’re
	going to settle down in any wilderness. You haven’t
	the faculty of adaptability of which I have spoken
	to-night at some length. And your heart is young
	and not coated with the holy varnish of callousness,
	which is a secret preparation known only to those
	who have served a long apprenticeship in a severe
	school of egotism.”</p>

	<p>“That’s all very well,” cried Doggie, “but what
	the——”</p>

	<p>Phineas waved an interrupting hand. “You’ve
	got to go back, laddie. You’ve got to whip all the
	moral courage in you and go back to Durdlebury.
	The Dean, with his influence, and the letter you
	have shown me from your Colonel, can easily get you
	some honourable employment in either Service not so
	exacting as the one which you have recently found yourself
	unable to perform.”</p>

	<p>Doggie threw a newly-lighted cigarette into the
	fire and turned passionately on McPhail.</p>

	<p>“I won’t. You’re talking drivelling rot. I
	can’t. I’d sooner die than go back there with my
	tail between my legs. I’d sooner enlist as a private
	soldier.”</p>

	<p>“Enlist?” said Phineas, and he drew himself up
	straight and gaunt. “Well, why not?”</p>

	<p>“Enlist?” echoed Doggie in a dull tone.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>“Have you never contemplated such a possibility?”</p>

	<p>“Good God, no!” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“I have enlisted. And I am a man of ancient
	lineage as honourable, so as not to enter into unproductive
	argument, as yours. And I am a Master of Arts
	of the two Universities of Glasgow and Cambridge.
	Yet I fail to find anything dishonourable in my present
	estate as 33702 Private Phineas McPhail in the British
	Army.”</p>

	<p>Doggie seemed not to hear him. He stared at him
	wildly.</p>

	<p>“Enlist?” he repeated. “As a Tommy?”</p>

	<p>“Even as a Tommy,” said Phineas. He glanced
	at the ormolu clock. “It is past one. The respectable
	widow woman near the Elephant and Castle
	who has let me a bedroom will be worn by anxiety
	as to my non-return. Marmaduke, my dear, dear
	laddie, I must leave you. If you will be lunching
	here twelve hours hence, nothing will give me greater
	pleasure than to join you. Laddie, do you think you
	could manage a fried sole and a sweetbread?”</p>

	<p>“Enlist?” said Doggie, following him out to the
	front door in a dream.</p>

	<p>He opened the door. Phineas shook hands.</p>

	<p>“Fried sole and a sweetbread at one-thirty?”</p>

	<p>“Of course, with pleasure,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Phineas fumbled in his pockets.</p>

	<p>“It’s a long cry at this time of night from Bloomsbury
	to the Elephant and Castle. You haven’t the
	price of a taxi fare about you, laddie—two or three
	pounds——?”</p>

	<p>Doggie drew from his patent note-case a sheaf of one-pound
	and ten-shilling treasury notes and handed them
	over to McPhail’s vulture clutch.</p>

	<p>“Good night, laddie!”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"> </a>“Good night!”</p>

	<p>Phineas strode away into the blackness. Doggie
	shut the front door and put up the chain and went
	back into his sitting-room. He wound his fingers
	in his hair.</p>

	<p>“Enlist? My God!”</p>

	<p>He lit a cigarette and after a few puffs flung it into
	the grate. He stared at the alternatives.</p>

	<p>Flight, which was craven—a lifetime of self-contempt.
	Durdlebury, which was impossible.
	Enlistment——?</p>

	<p>Yet what was a man incapable yet able-bodied,
	honourable though disgraced, to do?</p>

	<p>His landlord found him at seven o’clock in the
	morning asleep in an arm-chair.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_IX"><a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER IX</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">After</span> a bath and a change and breakfast,
	Doggie went out for one of his solitary walks.
	At Durdlebury such a night as the last would have
	kept him in bed in a darkened room for most of the
	following day. But he had spent many far, far worse
	on Salisbury Plain, and the inexorable reveille had
	dragged him out into the raw dreadful morning,
	heedless of his headache and yearning for slumber,
	until at last the process of hardening had begun.
	To-day Doggie was as unfatigued a young man as
	walked the streets of London, a fact which his mind
	was too confusedly occupied to appreciate. Once
	more was he beset less by the perplexities of the future
	than by a sense of certain impending doom. For to
	Phineas McPhail’s “Why not?” he had been able
	to give no answer. He could give no answer now, as
	he marched with swinging step, automatically, down
	Oxford Street and the Bayswater Road in the direction
	of Kensington Gardens. He could give no
	answer as he stood sightlessly staring at the Peter
	Pan statue.</p>

	<p>A one-armed man in a khaki cap and hospital blue
	came and stood by his side and looked in a pleased
	yet puzzled way at the exquisite poem in marble.
	At last he spoke—in a rich Irish accent.</p>

	<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but could you be telling
	me the meaning of it, at all?”</p>

	<p>Doggie awoke and smiled.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>“Do you like it?”</p>

	<p>“I do,” said the soldier.</p>

	<p>“It is about Peter Pan. A kind of Fairy Tale.
	You can see the ‘little people’ peeping out—I think
	you call them so in Ireland.”</p>

	<p>“We do that,” said the soldier.</p>

	<p>So Doggie sketched the outline of the immortal
	story of the Boy Who Will Never Grow Old, and the
	Irishman listened with deep interest.</p>

	<p>“Indeed,” said he after a time, “it is good to come
	back to the true things after the things out there.”
	He waved his one arm in the vague direction of the
	war.</p>

	<p>“Why do you call them true things?” Doggie
	asked quickly.</p>

	<p>They turned away, and Doggie found himself
	sitting on a bench by the man’s side.</p>

	<p>“It’s not me that can tell you that,” said he, “and
	my wife and children in Galway.”</p>

	<p>“Were you there at the outbreak of war?”</p>

	<p>He was. A reservist called back to the colours
	after some years of retirement from the army. He
	had served in India and South Africa, a hard-bitten
	soldier, proud of the traditions of his old regiment.
	There were scarcely any of them left—and that was
	all that was left of him. He smiled cheerily. Doggie
	condoled with him on the loss of his arm.</p>

	<p>“Ah sure,” he replied, “and it might keep me out
	of a fight when I go into Ballinasloe.”</p>

	<p>“Who would you want to fight?” asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>“The dirty Sinn Feiners that do be always shouting
	‘Freedom for Ireland and to hell with freedom
	for the rest of the world.’ If I haven’t lost my arm
	in a glorious cause, what have I lost it for? Can you
	tell me that?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>Doggie agreed that he had fought for the greater
	freedom of humanity and gave him a cigarette, and
	they went on talking. The Irishman had been in
	the retreat from Mons, the first battle of Ypres, and
	he had lost his arm in no battle at all; just a stray
	shell over the road as they were marching back to
	billets. They discussed the war, the ethics of it.
	Doggie still wanted to know why the realities of
	blood and mud and destruction were not the true
	things. Gradually he found that the Irishman meant
	that the true things were the spiritual, undying things;
	that the grim realities would pass away; that from
	these dead realities would arise the noble ideals of
	the future, which would be symbolized in song and
	marble; that all he had endured and sacrificed was
	but a part of the Great Sacrifice we were making
	for the Freedom of the World. Being a man roughly
	educated on a Galway farm and in an infantry regiment,
	he had great difficulty in co-ordinating his ideas;
	but he had a curious power of vision that enabled him
	to pierce to the heart of things, which he interpreted
	according to his untrained sense of beauty.</p>

	<p>They parted with expressions of mutual esteem.
	Doggie struck across the Gardens with a view to
	returning home by Knightsbridge, Piccadilly and
	Shaftesbury Avenue. He strode along, his thoughts
	filled with the Irish soldier. Here was a man,
	maimed for life and quite content that it should be so,
	who had reckoned all the horrors through which he
	had passed as externals unworthy of the consideration
	of his unconquerable soul; a man simple, unassuming,
	expansive only through his Celtic temperament,
	which allowed him to talk easily to a stranger
	before whom his English or Scotch comrade would
	have been dumb and gaping as an oyster; obviously
	<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>brave, sincere and loyal. Perhaps something even
	higher. Perhaps, in essence, the very highest. The
	Poet-Warrior. The term struck Doggie’s brain with
	a thud, like the explosive fusion of two elements.</p>

	<p>During his walk to Kensington Gardens a poisonous
	current had run at the back of his mind. Drifting
	on it, might he not escape? Was he not of too fine
	a porcelain to mingle with the coarse and common
	pottery of the ranks? Was it necessary to go into the
	thick of the coarse clay vessels, just to be shattered?
	It was easy for Phineas to proclaim that he found no
	derogation to his dignity as a man of birth and a
	university graduate in identifying himself with his
	fellow privates. Phineas had systematically brutalized
	himself into fitness for the position. He had armed
	himself in brass—<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">æs triplex</em>. He smiled at his own
	wit. But he, James Marmaduke Trevor, who had
	lived his life as a clean gentleman, was in a category
	apart.</p>

	<p>Now, he found that his talk with the Irishman had
	been an antidote to the poison. He felt ashamed.
	Did he dare set himself up to be finer clay than that
	common soldier? Spiritually, was he even of clay as
	fine? In a Great Judgment of Souls which of the
	twain would be among the Elect? The ultra-refined
	Mr. Marmaduke Trevor of Denby Hall, or the ignorant
	poet-warrior of Ballinasloe? “Not Doggie
	Trevor,” he said between his teeth. And he went
	home in a chastened spirit.</p>

	<p>Phineas McPhail appeared punctually at half-past
	one, and feasted succulently on fried sole and sweetbread.</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said he, “the man that can provide
	such viands is a Thing of Beauty which, as the poet
	says, is a Joy for Ever. The light in his window is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"> </a>a beacon to the hungry Tommy dragging himself
	through the viscous wilderness of regulation stew.”</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid it won’t be a beacon for very long,”
	said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Eh?” queried Phineas sharply. “You’d surely
	not be thinking of refusing an old friend a stray meal?”</p>

	<p>Doggie coloured at the coarseness of the misunderstanding.</p>

	<p>“How could I be such a brute? There won’t
	be a light in the window because I shan’t be there.
	I’m going to enlist.”</p>

	<p>Phineas put his elbows on the table and regarded
	him earnestly.</p>

	<p>“I would not take too seriously words spoken in
	the heat of midnight revelry, even though the revel
	was conducted on the genteelest principles. Have
	you thought of the matter in the cool and sober hours
	of the morning?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“It’s an unco’ hard life, laddie.”</p>

	<p>“The one I’m leading is a harder,” said Doggie.
	“I’ve made up my mind.”</p>

	<p>“Then I’ve one piece of advice to give you,” said
	McPhail. “Sink the name of Marmaduke, which
	would only stimulate the ignorant ribaldry of the canteen,
	and adopt the name of James, which your godfathers
	and godmothers, with miraculous foresight,
	considering their limitations in the matter of common
	sense, have given you.”</p>

	<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Also it would tend to the obliteration of class
	prejudices if you gave up smoking Turkish cigarettes
	at ten shillings a hundred and arrived in your platoon
	as an amateur of ‘fags.’”</p>

	<p>“I can’t stand ‘fags,’” said Doggie.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>“You can. The human organism is so constituted
	that it can stand the sweepings of the elephants’ house
	in the Zoological Gardens. Try. This time it’s only
	‘fags.’”</p>

	<p>Doggie took one from the crumpled paper packet
	which was handed to him, and lit it. He made a
	wry face, never before having smoked American
	tobacco.</p>

	<p>“How do you like the flavour?” asked Phineas.</p>

	<p>“I think I’d prefer the elephants’ house,” said
	Doggie, eyeing the thing with disgust.</p>

	<p>“You’ll find it the flavour of the whole British
	Army,” said McPhail.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">A few days later the Dean received a letter bearing
	the pencilled address of a camp on the south coast, and
	written by 35792 Pvte. James M. Trevor, A Company,
	2-10th Wessex Rangers. It ran:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“I hope you won’t think me heartless for having
		left you so long without news of me; but until lately
		I had the same reasons for remaining in seclusion as
		when I last wrote. Even now I’m not asking for
		sympathy or reconsideration of my failure or desire
		in any way to take advantage of the generosity of you
		all.</p>

		<p>“I have enlisted in the 10th Wessex. Phineas
		McPhail, whom I met in London and whose character
		for good or evil I can better gauge now than formerly,
		is a private in the same battalion. I don’t pretend
		to enjoy the life any more than I could enjoy living in
		a kraal of savages in Central Africa. But that is a
		matter of no account. I don’t propose to return to
		Durdlebury till the end of the war. I left it as an
		officer and I’m not coming back as a private soldier. I
		<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>enclose a cheque for £500. Perhaps Aunt Sophia
		will be so kind as to use the money—it ought to last
		some time—for the general upkeep, wages, etc., of
		Denby Hall. I feel sure she will not refuse me this
		favour. Give Peggy my love and tell her I hope
		she will accept the two-seater as a parting gift. It
		will make me happier to know that she is driving it.</p>

		<p>“I am keeping on as a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied à terre</em> in London the
		Bloomsbury rooms in which I have been living,
		and I’ve written to Peddle to see about making them
		more comfortable. Please ask anybody who might
		care to write to address me as ‘James M.’ and not
		as ‘Marmaduke.’”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The Dean read the letter—the family were at
	breakfast; then he took off his tortoise-shell spectacles
	and wiped them.</p>

	<p>“It’s from Marmaduke at last,” said he. “He has
	carried out my prophecy and enlisted.”</p>

	<p>Peggy caught at her breath and shot out her hand
	for the letter, which she read eagerly and then passed
	over to her mother. Mrs. Conover began to cry.</p>

	<p>“Oh, the poor boy! It will be worse than ever
	for him.”</p>

	<p>“It will,” said Peggy. “But I think it splendid
	of him to try. How did he bring himself to do it?”</p>

	<p>“Breed tells,” said the Dean. “That’s what
	every one seems to have forgotten. He’s a thoroughbred
	Doggie. There’s the old French proverb:
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon chien chasse de race.</em>”</p>

	<p>Peggy looked at him gratefully. “You’re very
	comforting,” she said.</p>

	<p>“We must knit him some socks,” observed Mrs.
	Conover. “I hear those supplied to the army are
	very rough and ready.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>“My dear,” smiled the Dean, “Marmaduke’s
	considerable income does not cease because his pay in
	the army is one and twopence a day; and I should
	think he would have the sense to provide himself
	with adequate underclothing. Also, judging from the
	account of your shopping orgy in London, he has
	already laid in a stock that would last out several
	Antarctic winters.”</p>

	<p>The Dean tapped his egg gently.</p>

	<p>“Then what can we do for the poor boy?” asked
	his wife.</p>

	<p>The Dean scooped the top of his egg off with a
	vicious thrust.</p>

	<p>“We can cut out slanderous tongues,” said he.</p>

	<p>There had been much calumniating cackle in the
	little town; nay, more: cackle is of geese; there
	had been venom of the snakiest kind. The Deanery,
	father and mother and daughter, each in their several
	ways, had suffered greatly. It is hard to stand up against
	poisoned ridicule.</p>

	<p>“My dear,” continued the Dean, “it will be our
	business to smite the Philistines, hip and thigh. The
	reasons which guided Marmaduke in the resignation
	of his commission are the concern of nobody. The
	fact remains that Mr. Marmaduke Trevor resigned
	his commission in order to——”</p>

	<p>Peggy interrupted with a smile. “‘In order to’—isn’t
	that a bit Jesuitical, daddy?”</p>

	<p>“I have a great respect for the Jesuits, my dear,”
	said the Dean, holding out an impressive egg-spoon.
	“The fact remains, in the eyes of the world, as I
	remarked, that Mr. Marmaduke Trevor of Denby
	Hall, a man of fortune and high position in the county,
	resigned his commission in order, for reasons best
	known to himself, to serve his country more effectively
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"> </a>in the humbler ranks of the army, and—my dear,
	this egg is far too full for war time”—with a hazardous
	plunge of his spoon he had made a yellow yelky
	horror of the egg-shell—“and I’m going to proclaim
	the fact far and wide, and—indeed—rub it in.”</p>

	<p>“That’ll be jolly decent of you, daddy,” said his
	daughter. “It will help a lot.”</p>

	<p>In the failure of Marmaduke to retain his commission
	the family honour had not been concerned.
	The boy had done his best. They blamed not him
	but the disastrous training that had unfitted him for
	the command of men. They reproached themselves
	for their haste in throwing him headlong into the
	fiercest element of the national struggle towards
	efficiency. They could have found an easier school,
	in which he could have learned to do his share creditably
	in the national work. Many young men of their
	acquaintance, far more capable than Marmaduke,
	were wearing the uniform of a less strenuous branch
	of the service. It had been a blunder, a failure, but
	without loss of honour. But when slanderous tongues
	attacked poor Doggie for running away with a yelp
	from a little hardship; when a story or two of Doggie’s
	career in the regiment arrived in Durdlebury, highly
	flavoured in transit and more and more poisoned as
	it went from mouth to mouth; when a legend was
	spread abroad that he had bolted from Salisbury
	Plain and was run to earth in a Turkish Bath in
	London, and was only saved from court-martial
	by family influence, then the family honour of the
	Conovers was wounded to its proud English depths.
	And they could say nothing. They had only Doggie’s
	word to go upon; they accepted it unquestioningly,
	but they knew no details. Doggie had disappeared.
	Naturally, they contradicted these evil rumours.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a>The good folks of Durdlebury expected them to do
	so, and listened with well-bred incredulity. To the
	question, “Where is he now and what is he going
	to do?” they could only answer, “We don’t know.”
	They were helpless.</p>

	<p>Peggy had a bitter quarrel with one of her intimates,
	Nancy Murdoch, daughter of the doctor who had
	proclaimed the soundness of Marmaduke’s constitution.</p>

	<p>“He may have told you so, dear,” said Nancy,
	“but how do you know?”</p>

	<p>“Because whatever else he may be, he’s not a
	liar,” retorted Peggy.</p>

	<p>Nancy gave the most delicate suspicion of a shrug
	to her pretty shoulders.</p>

	<p>That was the beginning of it. Peggy, naturally
	combative, armed for the fight and defended Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“You talk as though you were still engaged to
	him,” said Nancy.</p>

	<p>“So I am,” declared Peggy rashly.</p>

	<p>“Then where’s your engagement ring?”</p>

	<p>“Where I choose to keep it.”</p>

	<p>The retort lacked originality and conviction.</p>

	<p>“You can’t send it back to him, because you don’t
	know where he is. And what did Mrs. Conover
	mean by telling mother that Mr. Trevor had broken
	off the engagement?”</p>

	<p>“She never told her any such thing,” cried Peggy
	mendaciously. For Mrs. Conover had committed
	the indiscretion under assurance of silence.</p>

	<p>“Pardon me,” said Nancy, much on her dignity.
	“Of course I understand your denying it. It isn’t
	pleasant to be thrown over by any man—but by a
	man like Doggie Trevor——”</p>

	<p>“You’re a spiteful beast, Nancy, and I’ll never
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"> </a>speak to you again. You’ve neither womanly decency
	nor Christian feeling.” And Peggy marched out
	of the doctor’s house.</p>

	<p>As a result of the quarrel, however, she resumed
	the wearing of the ring, which she flaunted defiantly
	with left hand deliberately ungloved. Hitherto she
	had not been certain of the continuance of the engagement.
	Marmaduke’s repudiation was definite enough;
	but it had been dictated by his sensitive honour.
	It lay with her to agree or decline. She had passed
	through wearisome days of doubt. A physically
	sound fighting man sent about his business as being
	unfit for war does not appear a romantic figure in a
	girl’s eyes. She was bitterly disappointed with Doggie
	for the sudden withering of her hopes. Had he
	fulfilled them she could have loved him wholeheartedly,
	after the simple way of women; for her
	sex, exhilarated by the barbaric convulsion of the
	land, clamoured for something heroic, something
	at least intensely masculine, in which she could find
	feminine exultation. She also felt resentment at his
	flight from the Savoy, his silence and practical disappearance.
	Although not blaming him unjustly,
	she failed to realize the spiritual piteousness of his
	plight. If the war has done anything in this country,
	it has saved the young women of the gentler classes,
	at any rate, from the abyss of sordid and cynical
	materialism. Hesitating to announce the rupture
	of the engagement, she allowed it to remain in a state
	of suspended animation, and as a symbolic act, ceased
	to wear the ring. Nancy’s taunts had goaded her to
	a more heroic attitude. The first person to whom
	she showed the newly-ringed hand was her mother.</p>

	<p>“The engagement isn’t off until I declare it’s off.
	I’m going to play the game.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"> </a>“You know best, dear,” said the gentle Mrs.
	Conover. “But it’s all very upsetting.”</p>

	<p>Then Doggie’s letter brought comfort and gladness
	to the Deanery. It reassured them as to his fate.
	It healed the wounded family honour. It justified
	Peggy in playing the game.</p>

	<p>She took the letter round to Dr. Murdoch’s and
	thrust it into the hand of an astonished Nancy, with
	whom since the quarrel she had not been on speaking
	terms.</p>

	<p>“This is in Marmaduke’s handwriting. You
	recognize it. Just read the top line when I’ve folded
	it. ‘I have enlisted in the 10th Wessex.’ See?”
	She withdrew the letter. “Now, what could a man,
	let alone an honourable gentleman, do more? Say
	you’re sorry for having said beastly things about him.”</p>

	<p>Nancy, who had regretted the loss of a lifelong
	friendship, professed her sorrow.</p>

	<p>“The least you can do then, is to go round and
	spread the news, and say you’ve seen the letter with
	your own eyes.”</p>

	<p>To several others, on a triumphant round of visits,
	did she show the vindicating sentence. Any soft
	young fool, she asserted, with the directness and not
	unattractive truculence of her generation, can get a
	commission and muddle through, but it took a man to
	enlist as a private soldier.</p>

	<p>“Everybody recognizes now, darling,” said the
	reconciled Nancy a few days later, “that Doggie
	is a top-hole, splendid chap. But I think I ought
	to tell you that you’re boring Durdlebury stiff.”</p>

	<p>Peggy laughed. It was good to be engaged to a
	man no longer under a cloud.</p>

	<p>“It will all come right, dear old thing,” she wrote
	to Doggie. “It’s a cinch, as the Americans say.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"> </a>You’ll soon get used to it—especially if you can
	realize what it means to me. ‘Saving face’ has been
	an awful business. Now it’s all over. Of course,
	I’ll accept the two-seater. I’ve had lessons in driving
	since you went away—I had thoughts of going out
	to France to drive Y.M.C.A. cars, but that’s off for
	the present. I’ll love the two-seater. Swank won’t
	be the word. But ‘a parting gift’ is all rot. The
	engagement stands and all Durdlebury knows it…”
	and so on, and so on. She set herself out, honestly,
	loyally, to be the kindest girl in the world to Doggie.
	Mrs. Conover happened to come into the drawing-room
	just as she was licking the stamp. She thumped
	it on the envelope with her palm and, looking round
	from the writing-desk against the wall, showed her
	mother a flushed and smiling face.</p>

	<p>“If anybody says I’m not good—the goodest
	thing the cathedral has turned out for half a dozen
	centuries—I’ll tear her horrid eyes out from their
	sockets!”</p>

	<p>“My dear!” cried her horrified mother.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Doggie kept the letter unopened in his tunic pocket
	until he could find solitude in which to read it. After
	morning parade he wandered to the deserted trench
	at the end of the camp, where the stuffed sacks, representing
	German defenders, were hung for bayonet
	practice. It was a noon of grey mist through which
	the alignments of huts and tents were barely visible.
	Instinctively avoiding the wet earth of the parados,
	he went round, and, tired after the recent spell of
	physical drill, sat down on the equally wet sandbags
	of the model parapet, a pathetic, lonely little khaki
	figure isolated for the moment by the kindly mist from
	an uncomprehending world.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"> </a>He read Peggy’s letter several times. He recognized
	her goodness, her loyalty. The grateful tears
	even came to his eyes and he brushed them away hurriedly
	with a swift look round. But his heart beat
	none the faster. A long-faded memory of childhood
	came back to him in regained colour. Some quarrel
	with Peggy. What it was all about he had entirely
	forgotten; but he remembered her little flushed face
	and her angry words: “Well, I’m a sport and you
	ain’t!” He remembered also rebuking her priggishly
	for unintelligible language and mincing away.
	He read the letter again in the light of this flash of
	memory. The only difference between it and the
	childish speech lay in the fact that instead of a declaration
	of contrasts, she now uttered a declaration of
	similitudes. They were both “sports.” There she
	was wrong. Doggie shook his head. In her sense
	of the word he was not a “sport.” A sport takes
	chances, plays the game with a smile on his lips.
	There was no smile on his. He loathed the game with
	a sickening, shivering loathing. He was engaged in
	it because a conglomeration of irresistible forces had
	driven him into the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</em>. It never occurred to
	Doggie that he was under orders of his own soul.
	This simple yet stupendous fact never occurred to
	Peggy.</p>

	<p>He sat on the wet sandbags and thought and thought.
	Though he reproached himself for base ingratitude,
	the letter did not satisfy him. It left his heart cold.
	What he sought in it he did not know. It was something
	he could not find, something that was not
	there. The sea-mist thickened around him. Peggy
	seemed very far away…. He was still engaged
	to her—for it would be monstrous to persist in his
	withdrawal. He must accept the situation which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"> </a>she decreed. He owed that to her loyalty. But
	how to continue the correspondence? It was hard
	enough to write from Salisbury Plain; from here it
	was well-nigh impossible.</p>

	<p>Thus was Doggie brought up against a New Problem.
	He struggled desperately to defer its solution.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_X"><a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER X</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> regiments of the new armies have gathered
	into their rank and file a mixed crowd transcending
	the dreams of Democracy. At one end of
	the social scale are men of refined minds and gentle
	nurture, at the other creatures from the slums, with
	slum minds and morals, and between them the whole
	social gamut is run. Experience seems to show that
	neither of the extreme elements tend, in the one case
	to elevate, or in the other to debase the battalion.
	Leading the common life, sharing the common hardships,
	striving towards common ideals, they inevitably,
	irresistibly tend to merge themselves in the average.
	The highest in the scale sink, the lowest rise. The
	process, as far as the change of soul state is concerned,
	is infinitely more to the amelioration of the lowest
	than to the degradation of the highest. The one, also,
	is more real, the other more apparent. In the one
	case, it is merely the shuffling-off of manners, of habits,
	of prejudices, and the assuming of others horribly distasteful
	or humorously accepted, according to temperament;
	in the other case, it is an enforced education.
	And all the congeries of human atoms that make up
	the battalion, learn new and precious lessons and
	acquire new virtues—patience, obedience, courage,
	endurance…. But from the point of view of a
	decorous tea-party in a cathedral town, the tone—or
	the standard of manners, or whatever you would like
	by way of definition of that vague and comforting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"> </a>word—the tone of the average is deplorably low. The
	hooligan may be kicked for excessive foulness; but
	the rider of the high horse is brutally dragged down
	into the mire. The curious part of it all is that, the
	gutter element being eliminated altogether, the corporate
	standard of the remaining majority is lower
	than the standard of each individual.</p>

	<p>By developing a philosophical disquisition on some
	such lines did Phineas McPhail seek to initiate Doggie
	into the weird mysteries of the new social life. Doggie
	heard with his ears, but thought in terms of Durdlebury
	tea-parties. Nowhere in the mass could he find
	the spiritual outlook of his Irish poet-warrior. The
	individuals that may have had it kept it preciously to
	themselves. The outlook, as conveyed in speech, was
	grossly materialistic. From the language of the canteen
	he recoiled in disgust. He could not reconcile it
	with the nobler attributes of the users. It was in vain
	for Phineas to plead that he must accept the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">lingua
	franca</em> of the British Army like all other things appertaining
	thereto. Doggie’s stomach revolted against
	most of the other things. The disregard (from his
	point of view) of personal cleanliness universal in the
	ranks, filled him with dismay. Even on Salisbury
	Plain he had managed to get a little hot water for his
	morning tub. Here, save in the officers’ quarters—curiously
	remote, inaccessible paradise!—there was not
	such a thing as a tub in the place, let alone hot water
	to fill it. The men never dreamed of such a thing
	as a tub. As a matter of fact, they were scrupulously
	clean according to the lights of the British Tommy;
	but the lights were not those of Marmaduke Trevor.
	He had learned the supreme wisdom of keeping lips
	closed on such matters and did not complain, but all
	his fastidiousness rebelled. He hated the sluice of head
	<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"> </a>and shoulders with water from a bucket in the raw
	open air. His hands swelled, blistered and cracked;
	and his nails, once so beautifully manicured, grew
	rich black rims, and all the icy water in the buckets
	would not remove the grime.</p>

	<p>Now and then he went into the town and had a hot
	bath; but very few of the others ever seemed to think
	of such a thing. The habit of the British Army of
	going to bed in its day-shirt was peculiarly repellent.
	Yet Doggie knew that to vary from the sacred ways
	of his fellow-men was to bring disaster on his head.</p>

	<p>Some of the men slept under canvas still. But
	Doggie, fortunately as he reckoned (for he had begun
	to appreciate fine shades in misery), was put with a
	dozen others in a ramshackle hut of which the woodwork
	had warped and let in the breezes above, below,
	and all round the sides. Doggie, though dismally cold,
	welcomed the air for obvious reasons. They were
	fortunate, too, in having straw palliasses—recently provided
	when it was discovered that sleeping on badly
	boarded floors with fierce draughts blowing upwards
	along human spines was strangely fatal to human
	bodies—but Doggie found his bed very hard lying.
	And it smelt sour and sickly. For nights, in spite
	of fatigue, he could not sleep. His mates sang and
	talked and bandied jests and sarcasms of esoteric meaning.
	Some of the recruits from factories or farms
	satirized their officers for peculiarities common to
	their social caste and gave grotesque imitations of their
	mode of speech. Doggie wondered, but held his peace.
	The deadly stupidity and weariness of it all! And
	when the talk stopped and they settled to sleep, the
	snorings and mutterings and coughings began and kept
	poor Doggie awake most of the night. The irremediable,
	intimate propinquity with coarse humanity
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"> </a>oppressed him. He would have given worlds to go
	out, even into the pouring rain, and walk about the
	camp or sleep under a hedge, so long as he could be
	alone. And he would think longingly of his satinwood
	bedroom, with its luxurious bed and lavender-scented
	sheets, and of his beloved peacock and ivory
	room and its pictures and exquisite furniture and
	the great fire roaring up the chimney, and devise
	intricate tortures for the Kaiser who had dragged
	him down to this squalor.</p>

	<p>The meals—the rough cooking, the primitive
	service—the table manners of his companions, offended
	his delicate senses. He missed napkins. Never could
	he bring himself to wipe his mouth with the back of
	his hand and the back of his hand on the seat of his
	trousers. Nor could he watch with equanimity an
	honest soul pick his teeth with his little finger. But
	Doggie knew that acquiescence was the way of happiness
	and protest the way of woe.</p>

	<p>At first he made few acquaintances beyond those
	with whom he was intimately associated. It seemed
	more politic to obey his instincts and remain unobtrusive
	in company and drift away inoffensively when
	the chance occurred. One of the men with whom
	he talked occasionally was a red-headed little cockney
	by the name of Shendish. For some reason or the
	other—perhaps because his name conveyed a perfectly
	wrong suggestion of the Hebraic—he was always
	called “Mo” Shendish.</p>

	<p>“Don’t yer wish yer was back, mate?” he asked
	one day, having waited to speak till Doggie had
	addressed and stamped a letter which he was writing
	at the end of the canteen table.</p>

	<p>“Where?” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“’Ome, sweet ’ome. In the family castle, where
	<a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"> </a>gilded footmen ’ands sausage and mash about on trays
	and quarts of beer all day long. I do.”</p>

	<p>“You’re a lucky chap to have a castle,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Mo Shendish grinned. He showed little yellow
	teeth beneath a little red moustache.</p>

	<p>“I ain’t ’alf got one,” said he. “It’s in Mare
	Street, Hackney. I wish I was there now.”</p>

	<p>He sighed, and in an abstracted way he took a half-smoked
	cigarette from behind his ear and relit it.</p>

	<p>“What were yer before yer joined? Yer look like a
	clerk.” He pronounced it as if it were spelt with a “u.”</p>

	<p>“Something of the sort,” replied Doggie cautiously.</p>

	<p>“One can always tell you eddicated blokes. Making
	your five quid a week easy, I suppose?”</p>

	<p>“About that,” said Doggie. “What were you?”</p>

	<p>“I was making my thirty bob a week regular. I
	was in the fish business, I was. And now I’m
	serving my ruddy country at one and twopence a day.
	Funny life, ain’t it?”</p>

	<p>“I can’t say it’s very enjoyable,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Not the same as sitting in a snug orfis all day with
	a pen in your lily-white ’and, and going ’ome to your
	’igh tea in a top ’at. What made you join up?”</p>

	<p>“The force of circumstances,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Same ’ere,” said Mo; “only I couldn’t put it
	into such fancy language. First my pals went out
	one after the other. Then the gels began to look
	saucy at me, and at last one particular bit of skirt
	what I’d been walking out with took to promenading
	with a blighter in khaki. It’d have been silly of me
	to go and knock his ’ead off, so I enlisted. And it’s
	all right now.”</p>

	<p>“Just the same sort of thing in my case,” replied
	Doggie. “I’m glad things are right with the young
	lady.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"> </a>“First class. She’s straight, she is, and no mistake
	abaht it. She’s a——”</p>

	<p>He paused for a word to express the inexpressive
	she.</p>

	<p>“—A paragon—a peach?”—Doggie corrected
	himself. Then, as the sudden frown of perplexed
	suspicion was swiftly replaced by a grin of content,
	he was struck by a bright idea.</p>

	<p>“What’s her name?”</p>

	<p>“Aggie. What’s yours?”</p>

	<p>“Gladys,” replied Doggie with miraculous readiness
	of invention.</p>

	<p>“I’ve got her photograph,” Shendish confided in
	a whisper, and laid his hand on his tunic pocket.
	Then he looked round at the half-filled canteen to
	see that he was unobserved. “You won’t give me
	away if I show it yer, will yer?”</p>

	<p>Doggie swore secrecy. The photograph of Aggie,
	an angular, square-browed damsel, who looked as
	though she could guide the most recalcitrant of fishmongers
	into the paths of duty, was produced and
	thrust into Doggie’s hand. He inspected it with
	polite appreciation, while his red-headed friend regarded
	him with fatuous anxiety.</p>

	<p>“Charming! charming!” said Doggie in his
	pleasantest way. “What’s her colouring?”</p>

	<p>“Fair hair and blue eyes,” said Shendish.</p>

	<p>The kindly question, half idle yet unconsciously
	tactful, was one of those human things which cost
	so little but are worth so much. It gave Doggie a
	devoted friend.</p>

	<p>“Mo,” said he, a day or two later, “you’re such
	a decent chap. Why do you use such abominable
	language?”</p>

	<p>“Gawd knows,” smiled Mo, unabashed. “I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"> </a>suppose it’s friendly like.” He wrinkled his brow in
	thought for an instant. “That’s where I think
	you’re making a mistake, old pal, if you don’t mind
	my mentioning it. I know what yer are, but the
	others don’t. You’re not friendly enough. See
	what I mean? Supposin’ you say as you would in
	a city restoorang when you’re ’aving yer lunch, ‘Will
	yer kindly pass me the salt?’—well, that’s standoffish—they
	say ‘Come off it! ‘But if you look about
	and say, ‘Where’s the b——y salt?’ that’s friendly.
	They understand. They chuck it at you.”</p>

	<p>Said Doggie, “It’s very—I mean b——y—difficult.”</p>

	<p>So he tried to be friendly; and if he met with no
	great positive success, he at least escaped animosity.
	In his spare time he mooned about by himself, shy,
	disgusted, and miserable. Once, when a group of
	men were kicking a football about, the ball rolled his
	way. Instead of kicking it back to the expectant
	players, he picked it up and advanced to the nearest
	and handed it to him politely.</p>

	<p>“Thanks, mate,” said the astonished man, “but
	why didn’t you kick it?”</p>

	<p>He turned away without waiting for a reply.
	Doggie had not kicked it because he had never kicked
	a football in his life and shrank from an exhibition of
	incompetence.</p>

	<p>At drill things were easier than on Salisbury Plain,
	his actions being veiled in the obscurity of squad or
	platoon or company. Many others besides himself
	were cursed by sergeants and rated by subalterns and
	drastically entreated by captains. He had the consolation
	of community in suffering. As a trembling
	officer he had been the only one, the only one marked
	and labelled as a freak apart, the only one stuck in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"> </a>eternal pillory. Here were fools and incapables even
	more dull and ineffective than he. A plough-boy
	fellow-recruit from Dorsetshire, Pugsley by name,
	did not know right from left, and having mastered the
	art of forming fours, could not get into his brain the
	reverse process of forming front. He wept under the
	lash of the corporal’s tongue; and to Doggie these
	tears were healing dews of Heaven’s distillation.
	By degrees he learned the many arts of war as taught
	to the private soldier in England. He could refrain
	from shutting his eyes when he pressed the trigger
	of his rifle, but to the end of his career his shooting
	was erratic. He could perform with the weapon
	the other tricks of precision. Unencumbered he
	could march with the best. The torture of the
	heavy pack nearly killed him; but in time, as his
	muscles developed, he was able to slog along under the
	burden. He even learned to dig. That was the
	worst and most back-breaking art of all.</p>

	<p>Now and then Phineas McPhail and himself would
	get together and walk into the little seaside town. It
	was out of the season and there was little to look
	at save the deserted shops and the squall-fretted pier
	and the maidens of the place who usually were in
	company with lads in khaki. Sometimes a girl alone
	would give Doggie a glance of shy invitation, for Doggie
	in his short slight way was not a bad-looking
	fellow, carrying himself well and wearing his uniform
	with instinctive grace. But the damsel ogled in vain.</p>

	<p>On one such occasion Phineas burst into a guffaw.</p>

	<p>“Why don’t you talk to the poor body? She’s a
	respectable girl enough. Where’s the harm?”</p>

	<p>“Go ‘square-pushing’?” said Doggie contemptuously,
	using the soldiers’ slang for walking about with
	a young woman. “No, thank you.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"> </a>“And why not? I’m not counselling you, laddie,
	to plunge into a course of sensual debauchery. But
	a wee bit gossip with a pretty innocent girl——”</p>

	<p>“My dear good chap,” Doggie interrupted, “what
	on earth should I have in common with her?”</p>

	<p>“Youth.”</p>

	<p>“I feel as old as hell,” said Doggie bitterly.</p>

	<p>“You’ll be feeling older soon,” replied Phineas,
	“and able to look down on hell with feelings of
	superiority.”</p>

	<p>Doggie walked on in silence for a few paces. Then
	he said:</p>

	<p>“A thing I can’t understand is this mania for
	picking up girls—just to walk about the streets with
	them. It’s so inane. It’s a disease.”</p>

	<p>“Did you ever consider,” said Phineas, “how in
	a station less exalted than that which you used to
	adorn, the young of opposite sexes manage to meet,
	select and marry? Man, the British Army’s going
	to be a grand education for you in sociology.”</p>

	<p>“Well, at any rate, you don’t suppose I’m going
	to select and marry out of the street?”</p>

	<p>“You might do worse,” said Phineas. Then,
	after a slight pause, he asked: “Have you any news
	lately from Durdlebury?”</p>

	<p>“Confound Durdlebury!” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Phineas checked him with one hand and waved
	the other towards a hostelry on the other side of the
	street. “If you will give me the money in advance,
	so as to evade the ungenerous spirit of the no-treating
	law, you can stand me a quart of ale at the Crown and
	Sceptre and join me in drinking to its confusion.”</p>

	<p>So they entered the saloon bar of the public-house.
	Doggie drank a glass of beer while Phineas swallowed
	a couple of pints. Two or three other soldiers were
	<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"> </a>there, in whose artless talk McPhail joined lustily.
	Doggie, unobtrusive at the end of the bar, maintained
	a desultory and uncomfortable conversation with the
	barmaid, who was of the florid and hearty type, about
	the weather.</p>

	<p>Some days later, McPhail again made allusion to
	Durdlebury. Doggie again confounded it.</p>

	<p>“I don’t want to hear of it or think of it,” he
	exclaimed, in his nervous way, “until this filthy
	horror is over. They want me to get leave and go
	down and stay. They’re making my life miserable
	with kindness. I wish they’d let me alone. They
	don’t understand a little bit. I want to get through
	this thing alone, all by myself.”</p>

	<p>“I’m sorry I persuaded you to join a regiment in
	which you were inflicted with the disadvantage of my
	society,” said Phineas.</p>

	<p>Doggie threw out an impatient arm. “Oh, you
	don’t count,” said he.</p>

	<p>A few minutes afterwards, repenting his brusqueness,
	he tried to explain to Phineas why he did not
	count. The others knew nothing about him. Phineas
	knew everything.</p>

	<p>“And you know everything about Phineas,” said
	McPhail grimly. “Ay, ay, laddie,” he sighed,
	“I ken it all. When you’re in Tophet, a sympathetic
	Tophetuan with a wee drop of the milk of human
	kindness is more comfort than a radiant angel who
	showers down upon you, from the celestial Fortnum
	and Mason’s, potted shrimps and caviare.”</p>

	<p>The sombreness cleared for a moment from Doggie’s
	young brow.</p>

	<p>“I never can make up my mind, Phineas,” said he,
	“whether you’re a very wise man or an awful fraud.”</p>

	<p>“Give me the benefit of the doubt, laddie,” replied
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"> </a>McPhail. “It’s the grand theological principle of
	Christianity.”</p>

	<p>Time went on. The regiment was moved to the East
	Coast. On the journey a Zeppelin raid paralysed
	the railway service. Doggie spent the night under the
	lee of the bookstall at Waterloo Station. Men huddled
	up near him, their heads on their kit-bags, slept and
	snored. Doggie almost wept with pain and cold and
	hatred of the Kaiser. On the East Coast much the
	same life as on the South, save that the wind, as if
	Hun-sent, found its way more savagely to the skin.</p>

	<p>Then suddenly came the news of a large draft for
	France, which included both McPhail and Shendish.
	They went away on leave. The gladness with which
	he welcomed their return showed Doggie how great
	a part they played in his new life. In a day or two
	they would depart God knew whither, and he would
	be left in dreadful loneliness. Through him the two
	men, the sentimental Cockney fishmonger and the
	wastrel Cambridge graduate, had become friends.
	He spent with them all his leisure time.</p>

	<p>Then one of the silly tragi-comedies of life occurred.
	McPhail got drunk in the crowded bar of a little
	public-house in the village. It was the last possible
	drink together of the draft and their pals. The draft
	was to entrain before daybreak on the morrow. It
	was a foolish, singing, shouting khaki throng. McPhail,
	who had borrowed ten pounds from Doggie,
	in order to see him through the hardships of the Front,
	established himself close by the bar and was drinking
	whisky. He was also distributing surreptitious sixpences
	and shillings into eager hands, which would
	convert them into alcohol for eager throats. Doggie,
	anxious, stood by his side. The spirit from which
	McPhail had for so long abstained, mounted to his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"> </a>unaccustomed brain. He began to hector, and, master
	of picturesque speech, he compelled an admiring
	audience. Doggie did not realize the extent of his
	drunkenness until, vaunting himself as a Scot and
	therefore the salt of the army, he picked a quarrel
	with a stolid Hampshire giant, who professed to have
	no use for Phineas’s fellow-countrymen. The men
	closed. Suddenly some one shouted from the doorway:</p>

	<p>“Be quiet, you fools! The A.P.M.’s coming
	down the road.”</p>

	<p>Now the Assistant Provost Marshal, if he heard
	hell’s delight going on in a tavern, would naturally
	make an inquisitorial appearance. The combatants
	were separated. McPhail threw a shilling on the
	bar counter and demanded another whisky. He was
	about to lift the glass to his lips when Doggie, terrified
	as to what might happen, knocked the glass out of his
	hand.</p>

	<p>“Don’t be an ass,” he cried.</p>

	<p>Phineas was very drunk. He gazed at his old
	pupil, took off his cap, and, stretching over the bar,
	hung it on the handle of a beer-pull. Then, staggering
	back, he pointed an accusing finger.</p>

	<p>“He has the audacity to call me an ass. Little
	blinking Marmaduke Doggie Trevor. Little Doggie
	Trevor, whom I trained up from infancy in the way
	he shouldn’t go——”</p>

	<p>“Why Doggie Trevor?” some one shouted in
	inquiry.</p>

	<p>“Never mind,” replied Phineas with drunken
	impressiveness. “My old friend Marmaduke has
	spilled my whisky and called me an ass. I call him
	Doggie, little Doggie Trevor. You all bear witness
	he knocked the drink out of my mouth. I’ll never
	forgive him. He doesn’t like being called Doggie—and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"> </a>I’ve no—no pred’lex’n to be called an ass. I’ll
	be thinking I’m going just to strangle him.”</p>

	<p>He struck out his bony claws towards the shrinking
	Doggie; but stout arms closed round him and
	a horny hand was clamped over his mouth, and they
	got him through the bar and the back parlour into
	the yard, where they pumped water on his head.
	And when the A.P.M. and his satellites passed by,
	the quiet of The Whip in Hand was the holy peace
	of a nunnery.</p>

	<p>Doggie and Mo Shendish and a few other staunch
	souls got McPhail back to quarters without much
	trouble. On parting, the delinquent, semi-sobered,
	shook Doggie by the hand and smiled with an air of
	great affection.</p>

	<p>“I’ve been verra drunk, laddie. And I’ve been
	angry with you for the first time in my life. But
	when you knocked the glass out of my hand I thought
	you were in danger of losing your good manners in
	the army. We’ll have many a pow-wow together
	when you join me out there.”</p>

	<p>The matter would have drifted out of Doggie’s
	mind as one of no importance had not the detested
	appellation by which Phineas hailed him struck the
	imagination of his comrades. It filled a long-felt
	want, no nickname for Private J. M. Trevor having
	yet been invented. Doggie Trevor he was and Doggie
	Trevor he remained for the rest of his period of service.
	He resigned himself to the inevitable. The sting had
	gone out of the name through his comrades’ ignorance
	of its origin. But he loathed it as much as ever; it
	sounded in his ears an everlasting reproach.</p>

	<p>In spite of the ill turn done in drunkenness, Doggie
	missed McPhail. He missed Mo Shendish, his more
	constant companion, even more. Their place was in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"> </a>some degree taken, or rather usurped, for it was without
	Doggie’s volition, by “Taffy” Jones, once clerk to
	a firm of outside bookmakers. As Doggie had never
	seen a racecourse, had never made a bet, and was
	entirely ignorant of the names even of famous Derby
	winners, Taffy regarded him as an astonishing freak
	worth the attention of a student of human nature.
	He began to cultivate Doggie’s virgin mind by aid of
	reminiscence, and of such racing news as was to
	be found in the <cite>Sportsman</cite>. He was a garrulous
	person and Doggie a good listener. To please him
	Doggie backed horses, through the old firm, for small
	sums. The fact of his being a man of large independent
	means both he and Phineas (to his credit) had kept
	a close secret, his clerkly origin divined and promulgated
	by Mo Shendish being unquestioningly accepted, so
	the bets proposed by Taffy were of a modest nature.
	Once he brought off a forty to one chance. Taffy
	rushed to him with the news, dancing with excitement.
	Doggie’s stoical indifference to the winning of twenty
	pounds, a year’s army pay, gave him cause for great
	wonder. As Doggie showed similar equanimity when
	he lost, Taffy put him down as a born sportsman.
	He began to admire him tremendously.</p>

	<p>This friendship with Taffy is worth special record,
	for it was indirectly the cause of a little revolution in
	Doggie’s regimental life. Taffy was an earnest though
	indifferent performer on the penny whistle. It was
	his constant companion, the solace of his leisure moments
	and one of the minor tortures of Doggie’s
	existence. His version of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</em> was
	peculiarly excruciating.</p>

	<p>One day, when Taffy was playing it with dreadful
	variations of his own to an admiring group in the
	Y.M.C.A. hut, Doggie, his nerves rasped to the raw
	<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"> </a>by the false notes and maddening intervals, snatched
	it out of his hand and began to play himself. Hitherto,
	shrinking morbidly from any form of notoriety, he
	had shown no sign of musical accomplishment. But
	to-day the musician’s impulse was irresistible. He
	played the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</em> as no one there had heard it
	on penny whistle before. The hut recognized a
	master’s touch, for Doggie was a fine executant
	musician. When he stopped there was a roar: “Go
	on!” Doggie went on. They kept him whistling
	till the hut was crowded.</p>

	<p>Thenceforward he was penny-whistler, by excellence,
	to the battalion. He whistled himself into
	quite a useful popularity.</p>

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XI</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">“We’re</span> all very proud of you, Marmaduke,”
	said the Dean.</p>

	<p>“I think you’re just splendid,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>They were sitting in Doggie’s rooms in Woburn
	Place, Doggie having been given his three days’ leave
	before going to France. Once again Durdlebury had
	come to Doggie and not Doggie to Durdlebury.
	Aunt Sophia, however, somewhat ailing, had stayed
	at home.</p>

	<p>Doggie stood awkwardly before them, conscious of
	swollen hands and broken nails, shapeless ammunition
	boots and ill-fitting slacks; morbidly conscious, too,
	of his original failure.</p>

	<p>“You’re about ten inches more round the chest
	than you were,” said the Dean admiringly.</p>

	<p>“And the picture of health,” cried Peggy.</p>

	<p>“For anyone who has a sound constitution,”
	answered Doggie, “it is quite a healthy life.”</p>

	<p>“Now that you’ve got into the way, I’m sure you
	must really love it,” said Peggy with an encouraging
	smile.</p>

	<p>“It isn’t so bad,” he replied.</p>

	<p>“What none of us can quite understand, my dear
	fellow,” said the Dean, “is your shying at Durdlebury.
	As we have written you, everybody’s singing your
	praises. Not a soul but would have given you a
	hearty welcome.”</p>

	<p>“Besides,” Peggy chimed in, “you needn’t have
	<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"> </a>made an exhibition of yourself in the town if you didn’t
	want to. The poor Peddles are woefully disappointed.”</p>

	<p>“There’s a war going on. They must bear up—like
	lots of other people,” replied Doggie.</p>

	<p>“He’s becoming quite cynical,” Peggy laughed.
	“But, apart from the Peddles, there’s your own
	beautiful house waiting for you. It seems so funny
	not to go to it, instead of moping in these fusty lodgings.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps,” said Doggie quietly, “if I went there
	I should never want to come back.”</p>

	<p>“There’s something to be said from that point of
	view,” the Dean admitted. “A solution of continuity
	is never quite without its dangers. Even Oliver
	confessed as much.”</p>

	<p>“Oliver?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, didn’t Peggy tell you?”</p>

	<p>“I didn’t think Marmaduke would be interested,”
	said Peggy quickly. “He and Oliver have never
	been what you might call bosom friends.”</p>

	<p>“I shouldn’t have minded about hearing of him,”
	said Doggie. “Why should I? What’s he doing?”</p>

	<p>The Dean gave information. Oliver, now a captain,
	had come home on leave a month ago, and had
	spent some of it at the Deanery. He had seen a good
	deal of fighting, and had one or two narrow escapes.</p>

	<p>“Was he keen to get back?” asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>The Dean smiled. “I instanced his case in my
	remark as to the dangers of the solution of
	continuity.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, rubbish, daddy,” cried his daughter, with a
	flush, “Oliver is as keen as mustard.” The Dean
	made a little gesture of submission. She continued.
	“He doesn’t like the beastliness out there for its own
	sake, any more than Marmaduke will. But he simply
	<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"> </a>loves his job. He has improved tremendously. Once
	he thought he was the only man in the country who
	had seen Life stark naked, and he put on frills accordingly
	Now that he’s just one of a million who have
	been up against Life stripped to its skeleton, he’s a bit
	subdued.”</p>

	<p>“I’m glad of that,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>The Dean, urbanely indulgent, joined his fingertips
	together and smiled. “Peggy is right,” said he,
	“although I don’t wholly approve of her modern
	lack of reticence in metaphor. Oliver is coming out
	true gold from the fire. He’s a capital fellow. And
	he spoke of you, my dear Marmaduke, in the kindest
	way in the world. He has a tremendous admiration
	for your pluck.”</p>

	<p>“That’s very good of him, I’m sure,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Presently the Dean—good, tactful man—discovered
	that he must go out and have a prescription made up
	at a chemist’s. That arch-Hun enemy, the gout,
	against which he must never be unprepared. He
	would be back in time for dinner. The engaged
	couple were left alone.</p>

	<p>“Well?” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Well, dear?” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Her lips invited. He responded. She drew him
	to the saddle-bag sofa, and they sat down side by side.</p>

	<p>“I quite understand, dear old thing,” she said. “I
	know the resignation and the rest of it hurt you
	awfully. It hurt me. But it’s no use grousing over
	spilt milk. You’ve already mopped it all up. It’s
	no disgrace to be a private. It’s an honour. There
	are thousands of gentlemen in the ranks. Besides—you’ll
	work your way up and they’ll offer you another
	commission in no time.”</p>

	<p>“You’re very good and sweet, dear,” said Doggie,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"> </a>“to have such faith in me. But I’ve had a year——”</p>

	<p>“A year!” cried Peggy. “Good lord! so it is.”
	She counted on her fingers. “Not quite. But eleven
	months. It’s eleven months since I’ve seen you. Do
	you realize that? The war has put a stop to time.
	It is just one endless day.”</p>

	<p>“One awful, endless day,” Doggie acquiesced with
	a smile. “But I was saying—I’ve had a year, or an
	endless day of eleven months, in which to learn myself.
	And what I don’t know about myself isn’t knowledge.”</p>

	<p>Peggy interrupted with a laugh. “You must be
	a wonder. Dad’s always preaching about self-knowledge.
	Tell me all about it.”</p>

	<p>Doggie shook his head, at the same time passing
	his hand over it in a familiar gesture.</p>

	<p>Then Peggy cried:</p>

	<p>“I knew there was something wrong with you.
	Why didn’t you tell me? You’ve had your hair cut—cut
	quite differently.”</p>

	<p>It was McPhail, careful godfather, who had taken
	him as a recruit to the regimental barber and prescribed
	a transformation from the sleek long hair brushed
	back over the head to a conventional military crop
	with a rudiment of a side parting. On the crown a
	few bristles stood up as if uncertain which way to go.</p>

	<p>“It’s advisable,” Doggie replied, “for a Tommy’s
	hair to be cut as short as possible. The Germans are
	sheared like convicts.”</p>

	<p>Peggy regarded him open-eyed and puzzle-browed.
	He enlightened her no further, but pursued the main
	proposition.</p>

	<p>“I wouldn’t take a commission,” said he, “if the
	War Office went mad and sank on its knees and beat
	its head in the dust before me.”</p>

	<p>“In Heaven’s name, why not?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"> </a>“I’ve learned my place in the world,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Peggy shook him by the shoulder and turned on
	him her young eager face.</p>

	<p>“Your place in the world is that of a cultivated
	gentleman of old family, Marmaduke Trevor of Denby
	Hall.”</p>

	<p>“That was the funny old world,” said he, “that
	stood on its legs—legs wide apart with its hands beneath
	the tails of its dress-coat, in front of the drawing-room
	fire. The present world’s standing on its head.
	Everything’s upside-down. It has no sort of use for
	Marmaduke Trevor of Denby Hall. No more use
	than for Goliath. By the way, how is the poor
	little beast getting on?”</p>

	<p>Peggy laughed. “Oh, Goliath is perfectly assured
	of his position. He has got it rammed into his mind
	that he drives the two-seater.” She returned to the
	attack. “Do you intend always to remain a private?”</p>

	<p>“I do,” said he. “Not even a corporal. You
	see, I’ve learned to be a private of sorts, and that
	satisfies my ambition.”</p>

	<p>“Well, I give it up,” said Peggy. “Though why
	you wouldn’t let dad get you a nice cushy job is
	a thing I can’t understand. For the life of me I
	can’t.”</p>

	<p>“I’ve made my bed, and I must lie on it,” he said
	quietly.</p>

	<p>“I don’t believe you’ve got such a thing as a bed.”</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled. “Oh yes, a bed of a sort.” Then
	noting her puzzled face, he said consolingly: “It’ll
	all come right when the war’s over.”</p>

	<p>“But when will that be? And who knows, my
	dear man, what may happen to you?”</p>

	<p>“If I’m knocked out, I’m knocked out, and there’s
	an end of it,” replied Doggie philosophically.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"> </a>She put her hand on his. “But what’s to become
	of me?”</p>

	<p>“We needn’t cry over my corpse yet,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>The Dean, after awhile, returned with his bottle
	of medicine, which he displayed with conscientious
	ostentation. They dined. Peggy again went over
	the ground of the possible commission.</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid she has set her heart on it, my boy,”
	said the Dean.</p>

	<p>Peggy cried a little on parting. This time Doggie
	was going, not to the fringe, but to the heart of the
	Great Adventure. Into the thick of the carnage. A
	year ago, she said, through her tears, she would have
	thought herself much more fitted for it than Marmaduke.</p>

	<p>“Perhaps you are still, dear,” said Doggie, with
	his patient smile.</p>

	<p>He saw them to the taxi which was to take them
	to the familiar Sturrocks’s. Before getting in, Peggy
	embraced him.</p>

	<p>“Keep out of the way of shells and bullets as much
	as you can.”</p>

	<p>The Dean blew his nose, God-blessed him, and
	murmured something incoherent about fighting for the
	glory of old England.</p>

	<p>“Good luck,” cried Peggy from the window.</p>

	<p>She blew him a kiss. The taxi drove off, and Doggie
	went back into the house with leaden feet. The
	meeting, which he had morbidly dreaded, had brought
	him no comfort. It had not removed the invisible
	barrier between Peggy and himself. But Peggy
	seemed so unconscious of it that he began to wonder
	whether it only existed in his diseased imagination.
	Though by his silences and reserves he had given her
	cause for resentment and reproach, her attitude was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"> </a>nothing less than angelic. He sat down moodily in
	an arm-chair, his hands deep in his trousers pockets and
	his legs stretched out. The fault lay in himself, he
	argued. What was the matter with him? He seemed
	to have lost all human feeling, like the man with the
	stone heart in the old legend. Otherwise, why had
	he felt no prick of jealousy at Peggy’s admiring comprehension
	of Oliver? Of course he loved her. Of
	course he wanted to marry her when this nightmare
	was over. That went without saying. But why
	couldn’t he look to the glowing future? A poet had
	called a lover’s mistress “the lode-star of his one
	desire.” That to him Peggy ought to be. Lode-star.
	One desire. The words confused him. He
	had no lode-star. His one desire was to be left alone.
	Without doubt he was suffering from some process
	of moral petrifaction.</p>

	<p>Doggie was no psychologist. He had never acquired
	the habit of turning himself inside-out and gloating
	over the horrid spectacle. All his life he had been
	a simple soul with simple motives and a simple though
	possibly selfish standard to measure them. But now
	his soul was knocked into a chaotic state of complexity,
	and his poor little standards were no manner of use.
	He saw himself as in a glass darkly, mystified by
	unknown change.</p>

	<p>He rose, sighed, shook himself.</p>

	<p>“I give it up,” said he, and went to bed.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Doggie went to France; a France hitherto undreamed
	of, either by him or by any young Englishman;
	a France clean swept and garnished for war;
	a France, save for the ubiquitous English soldiery, of
	silent towns and empty villages and deserted roads;
	a France of smiling fields and sorrowful faces of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"> </a>women and drawn patient faces of old men—and even
	then the women and old men were rarely met by
	day, for they were at work on the land, solitary figures
	on the landscape, with vast spaces between them. In
	the quiet townships, English street signs and placards
	conflicted with the sense of being in friendly provincial
	France, and gave the impression of foreign domination.
	For beyond that long grim line of eternal thunder,
	away over there in the distance, which was called
	the Front, street signs and placards in yet another alien
	tongue also outraged the serene genius of French urban
	life. Yet our signs were a symbol of a mighty Empire’s
	brotherhood, and the dimmed eyes that beheld the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de la Fontaine</em> transformed into “Holborn
	Circus,” and the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Rue</em> into “Piccadilly,” smiled,
	and the owners, with eager courtesy, directed the
	stray Tommy to “Regent Street,” which they had
	known all their life as the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Feuillemaisnil</em>—a word
	which Tommy could not pronounce, still less remember.
	It was as much as Tommy could do to
	get hold of an approximation to the name of the town.
	And besides these renamings, other inscriptions flamed
	about the streets; alphabetical hieroglyphs, in which
	the mystic letters H.Q. most often appeared; “This
	way to the Y.M.C.A. hut”; in many humble
	windows the startling announcement, “Washing done
	here.” British motor-lorries and ambulances crowding
	the little <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place</em> and aligned along the avenues.
	British faces, British voices, everywhere. The blue
	uniform and blue helmet of a French soldier seemed
	as incongruous though as welcome as in London.</p>

	<p>And the straight endless roads, so French with
	their infinite border of poplars, their patient little
	stones marking every hundred metres until the tenth
	rose into the proud kilometre stone proclaiming the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"> </a>distance to the next stately town, rang too with the
	sound of British voices, and the tramp of British feet,
	and the clatter of British transport, and the screech
	and whir of cars, revealing as they passed the flash of
	red and gold of the British staff. Yet the finely
	cultivated land remained to show that it was France;
	and the little whitewashed villages; the curé, in
	shovel-hat and rusty cassock; the children in blue or
	black blouses, who stared as the British troops went
	by; the patient, elderly French Territorials in their
	old pre-war uniforms, guarding unthreatened culverts
	or repairing the roads; the helpful signs set up in
	happier days by the Touring Club of France.</p>

	<p>Into this strange anomaly of a land came Doggie
	with his draft, still half stupefied by the remorselessness
	of the stupendous machine in which he had been
	caught, in spite of his many months of training in
	England. He had loathed the East Coast camp.
	When he landed at Boulogne in the dark and the pouring
	rain and hunched his pack with the others who
	went off singing to the rest camp, he regretted East
	Anglia.</p>

	<p>“Give us a turn on the whistle, Doggie,” said a
	corporal.</p>

	<p>“I was sea-sick into it and threw it overboard,”
	he growled, stumbling over the rails of the quay.</p>

	<p>“Oh, you holy young liar!” said the man next
	him.</p>

	<p>But Doggie did not trouble to reply, his neighbour
	being only a private like himself.</p>

	<p>Then the draft joined its unit. In his youth Doggie
	had often wondered at the meaning of the familiar
	inscription on every goods van in France: “40
	Hommes. 8 Chevaux.” Now he ceased to wonder.
	He was one of the forty men…. At the rail-head
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"> </a>he began to march, and at last joined the remnant
	of his battalion. They had been through hard fighting,
	and were now in billets. Until he joined them
	he had not realized the drain there had been on the
	reserves at home. Very many familiar faces of officers
	were missing. New men had taken their place. And
	very many of his old comrades had gone, some to
	Blighty, some West of that Island of Desire; and
	those who remained had the eyes of children who
	had passed through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.</p>

	<p>McPhail and Mo Shendish had passed through
	unscathed. In the reconstruction of the regiment
	chance willed that the three of them found themselves
	in the same platoon of A Company. Doggie almost
	embraced them when they met.</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said McPhail to him, as he was drinking
	a mahogany-coloured liquid that was known by
	the name of tea, out of a tin mug, and eating a hunk
	of bread and jam, “I don’t know whether or not
	I’m pleased to see you. You were safer in England.
	Once I misspent many months of my life in shielding
	you from the dangers of France. But France
	is a much more dangerous place nowadays, and I
	can’t help you. You’ve come right into the thick
	of it. Just listen to the hell’s delight that’s going
	on over yonder.”</p>

	<p>The easterly wind brought them the roar streaked
	with stridence of the artillery duel in progress on
	the nearest sector of the Front.</p>

	<p>They were sitting in the cellar entrance to a house
	in a little town which had already been somewhat
	mauled. Just opposite was a shuttered house on the
	ground floor of which had been a hatter and hosier’s
	shop, and there still swung bravely on an iron rod
	the red brim of what once had been a monstrous red
	<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"> </a>hat. Next door, the façade of the upper stories had
	been shelled away and the naked interiors gave the
	impression of a pathetic doll’s house. Women’s
	garments still hung on pegs. A cottage piano lurched
	forward drunkenly on three legs, with the keyboard
	ripped open, the treble notes on the ground, the bass
	incongruously in the air. In the attic, ironically
	secure, hung a cheap German print of blowsy children
	feeding a pig. The wide flagstoned street smelt sour.
	At various cavern doors sat groups of the billeted
	soldiers. Now and then squads marched up and down,
	monotonously clad in khaki and dun-coloured helmets.
	Officers, some only recognizable by the Sam Browne
	belt, others spruce and point-device, passed by. Here
	and there a shop was open, and the elderly proprietor
	and his wife stood by the doorway to get the afternoon
	air. Women and children straggled rarely through
	the streets. The Boche had left the little town alone
	for some time; they had other things to do with their
	heavy guns; and all the French population, save those
	whose homes were reduced to nothingness, had remained.
	They took no notice of the distant bombardment.
	It had grown to be a phenomenon of
	nature like the wind and the rain.</p>

	<p>But to Doggie it was new—just as the sight of the
	wrecked house opposite, with its sturdy crownless
	hat-brim of a sign, was new. He listened, as McPhail
	had bidden him, to the artillery duel with an odd little
	spasm of his heart.</p>

	<p>“What do you think of that, now?” asked McPhail
	grandly, as if it was The Greatest Show on Earth
	run by him, the Proprietor.</p>

	<p>“It’s rather noisy,” said Doggie, with a little
	ironical twist of his lips that was growing habitual.
	“Do they keep it up at night?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"> </a>“They do.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t think it’s fair to interfere with one’s sleep
	like that,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You’ve got to adapt yourself to it,” said McPhail
	sagely. “No doubt you’ll be remembering my theory
	of adaptability. Through that I’ve made myself
	into a very brave man. When I wanted to run
	away—a very natural desire, considering the scrupulous
	attention I’ve always paid to my bodily well-being—I
	reflected on the preposterous obstacles put in the
	way of flight by a bowelless military system, and
	adapted myself to the static and dynamic conditions
	of the trenches.”</p>

	<p>“Gorblime!” said Mo Shendish, stretched out by
	his side, “just listen to him!”</p>

	<p>“I suppose you’ll say you sucked honey out of the
	shells,” remarked Doggie.</p>

	<p>“I’m no great hand at mixing metaphors——”</p>

	<p>“What about drinks?” asked Mo.</p>

	<p>“Nor drinks either,” replied McPhail. “Both
	are bad for the brain. But as to what you were
	saying, laddie, I’ll not deny that I’ve derived considerable
	interest and amusement from a bombardment.
	Yet it has its sad aspect.” He paused for a moment
	or two. “Man,” he continued, “what an awful
	waste of money!”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know what old Mac is jawing about,”
	said Mo Shendish, “but you can take it from me he’s
	a holy terror with the bayonet. One moment he’s
	talking to a Boche through his hat and the next the
	Boche is wriggling like a worm on a bent pin.”</p>

	<p>Mo winked at Phineas. The temptation to “tell
	the tale” to the new-comer was too strong.</p>

	<p>Doggie grew very serious. “You’ve been killing
	men—like that?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"> </a>“Thousands, laddie,” replied Phineas, the picture
	of unboastful veracity. “And so has Mo.”</p>

	<p>Mo Shendish, helmeted, browned, dried, toughened,
	a very different Mo from the pallid ferret whom Aggie
	had driven into the ranks of war, hunched himself
	up, his hands clasping his knees.</p>

	<p>“I don’t mind doing it, when you’re so excited you
	don’t know where you are,” said he, “but I don’t
	like thinking of it afterwards.”</p>

	<p>As a matter of fact, he had only once got home
	with the bayonet and the memory was unpleasant.</p>

	<p>“But you’ve just thought of it,” said Phineas.</p>

	<p>“It was you, not me,” said Mo. “That makes
	all the difference.”</p>

	<p>“It’s astonishing,” Phineas remarked sententiously,
	“how many people not only refuse to catch pleasure
	as it flies, but spurn it when it sits up and begs at them.
	Laddie,” he turned to Doggie, “the more one wallows
	in hedonism, the more one realizes its unplumbed
	depths.”</p>

	<p>A little girl of ten, neatly pigtailed but piteously
	shod, came near and cast a child’s envious eye on
	Doggie’s bread and jam.</p>

	<p>“Approach, my little one,” Phineas cried in French
	words but with the accent of Sauchiehall Street. “If
	I gave you a franc, what would you do with it?”</p>

	<p>“I should buy nourishment (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la nourriture</em>) for
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maman</em>.”</p>

	<p>“Lend me a franc, laddie,” said McPhail, and
	when Doggie had slipped the coin into his palm, he
	addressed the child in unintelligible grandiloquence
	and sent her on her way mystified but rejoicing.
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ces bons drôles d’Anglais!</em></p>

	<p>“Ah, laddie!” cried Phineas, stretching himself
	out comfortably by the jamb of the door, “you’ve got
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"> </a>to learn to savour the exquisite pleasure of a genuinely
	kindly act.”</p>

	<p>“Hold on!” cried Mo. “It was Doggie’s money
	you were flinging about.”</p>

	<p>McPhail withered him with a glance.</p>

	<p>“You’re an unphilosophical ignoramus,” said he.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XII"><a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Perhaps</span> one of the greatest influences which
	transformed Doggie into a fairly efficient though
	undistinguished infantryman was a morbid social
	terror of his officers. It saved him from many a
	guard-room, and from many a heart-to-heart talk
	wherein the zealous lieutenant gets to know his men.
	He lived in dread lest military delinquency or civil
	accomplishment should be the means of revealing the
	disgrace which bit like an acid into his soul. His
	undisguisable air of superior breeding could not fail to
	attract notice. Often his officers asked him what he
	was in civil life. His reply, “A clerk, sir,” had to
	satisfy them. He had developed a curious self-protective
	faculty of shutting himself up like a hedgehog
	at the approach of danger. Once a breezy
	subaltern had selected him as his batman; but Doggie’s
	agonized, “It would be awfully good of you, sir,
	if you wouldn’t mind not thinking of it,” and the
	appeal in his eyes, established the freemasonry of
	caste and saved him from dreaded intimate relations.</p>

	<p>“All right, if you’d rather not, Trevor,” said the
	subaltern. “But why doesn’t a chap like you try
	for a commission?”</p>

	<p>“I’m much happier as I am, sir,” replied Doggie,
	and that was the end of the matter.</p>

	<p>But Phineas, when he heard of it—it was on the
	East Coast—began: “If you still consider yourself
	too fine to clean another man’s boots——”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"> </a>Doggie, in one of his quick fits of anger, interrupted:
	“If you think I’m just a dirty little snob, if
	you don’t understand why I begged to be let off,
	you’re the thickest-headed fool in creation!”</p>

	<p>“I’m nae that, laddie,” replied Phineas, with his
	usual ironic submissiveness. “Haven’t I kept your
	secret all this time?”</p>

	<p>Thus it was Doggie’s fixed idea to lose himself in
	the locust swarm, to be prominent neither for good
	nor evil, even in the little clot of fifty, outwardly,
	almost identical locusts that formed his platoon. It
	braced him to the performance of hideous tasks; it
	restrained him from display of superior intellectual
	power or artistic capability. The world upheaval had
	thrown him from his peacock and ivory room, with
	its finest collection on earth of little china dogs, into
	a horrible fetid hole in the ground in Northern France.
	It had thrown not the average young Englishman of
	comfortable position, who had toyed with æsthetic
	superficialities as an amusement, but a poor little
	by-product of cloistered life who had been brought
	up from babyhood to regard these things as the nervous
	texture of his very existence. He was wrapped from
	head to heel in fine net, to every tiny mesh of which
	he was acutely sensitive.</p>

	<p>A hole in the ground in Northern France. The
	regiment, after its rest, moved on and took its turn
	in the trenches. Four days on; four days off.
	Four days on of misery inconceivable. Four days
	on, during which the officers watched the men with
	the unwavering vigilance of kindly cats:</p>

	<p>“How are you getting along, Trevor?”</p>

	<p>“Nicely, thank you, sir.”</p>

	<p>“Feet all right?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, thank you, sir.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"> </a>“Sure? If you want to grouse, grouse away.
	That’s what I’m talking to you for.”</p>

	<p>“I’m perfectly happy, sir.”</p>

	<p>“Darn sight more than I am!” laughed the
	subaltern, and with a cheery nod in acknowledgment
	of Doggie’s salute, splashed down the muddy trench.</p>

	<p>But Doggie was chilled to the bone, and he had
	no feeling in his feet, which were under six inches of
	water, and his woollen gloves being wet through were
	useless, and prevented his numbed hands from feeling
	the sandbags with which he and the rest of the platoon
	were repairing the parapet; for the Germans had
	just consecrated an hour’s general hate to the vicinity
	of the trench, and its exquisite symmetry, the pride of
	the platoon commander, had been disturbed. There
	had also been a few ghastly casualties. A shell had
	fallen and burst in the traverse at the far end of the
	trench. Something that looked like half a man’s
	head and a bit of shoulder had dropped just in front
	of the dug-out where Doggie and his section was
	sheltering. Doggie staring at it was violently sick.
	In a stupefied way he found himself mingling with
	others who were engaged in clearing up the horror.
	A murmur reached him that it was Taffy Jones who
	had thus been dismembered…. The bombardment
	over, he had taken his place with the rest in
	the reparation of the parapet; and as he happened
	to be at an end of the line, the officer had spoken to him.
	If he had been suffering tortures unknown to Attila,
	and unimagined by his successors, he would have
	answered just the same.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">But he lamented Taffy’s death to Phineas, who
	listened sympathetically. Such a cheery comrade,
	such a smart soldier, such a kindly soul.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"> </a>“Not a black spot in him,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“A year ago, laddie,” said McPhail, “what
	would have been your opinion of a bookmaker’s
	clerk?”</p>

	<p>“I know,” replied Doggie. “But this isn’t a
	year ago. Just look round.”</p>

	<p>He laughed somewhat hysterically, for the fate of
	Taffy had unstrung him for the time. Phineas contemplated
	the length of deep narrow ditch, with its
	planks half swimming on filthy liquid, its wire revetment
	holding up the oozing sides, the dingy parapet
	above which it was death to put one’s head, the grey
	free sky, the only thing free along that awful row of
	parallel ditches that stretched from the Belgian coast
	to Switzerland, the clay-covered, shapeless figures of
	men, their fellows, almost undistinguishable even by
	features from themselves.</p>

	<p>“It has been borne upon me lately,” said Phineas,
	“that patriotism is an amazing virtue.”</p>

	<p>Doggie drew a foot out of the mud so as to find a
	less precarious purchase higher up the slope.</p>

	<p>“And I’ve been thinking, Phineas, whether it’s
	really patriotism that has brought you and me into
	this—what can we call it? Dante’s Inferno is child’s
	play to it.”</p>

	<p>“Dante had no more imagination,” said Phineas,
	“than a Free Kirk precentor in Kirkcudbright.”</p>

	<p>“But is it patriotism?” Doggie persisted. “If I
	thought it was, I should be happier. If we had orders
	to go over the top and attack and I could shout ‘England
	for ever!’ and lose myself just in the thick of
	it——”</p>

	<p>“There’s a brass hat coming down the trench,”
	said Phineas, “and brass hats have no use for rhapsodical
	privates.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"> </a>They stood to attention as the staff officer passed
	by. Then Doggie broke in impatiently:</p>

	<p>“I wish to goodness you could understand what
	I’m trying to get at.”</p>

	<p>A smile illuminated the gaunt, unshaven, mud-caked
	face of Phineas McPhail.</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said he, “let England, as an abstraction,
	fend for itself. But you’ve a bonny English soul
	within you, and for that you are fighting. And so
	had poor Taffy Jones. And I have a bonny Scottish
	thirst, the poignancy of which both of you have been
	happily spared. I will leave you, laddie, to seek in
	slumber a surcease from martyrdom.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Doggie had been out a long time. He had seen
	many places, much fighting and endured manifold
	miseries. After one of the spells in the trenches,
	the worst he had experienced, A Company was
	marched into new billets some miles behind the lines,
	in the once prosperous village of Frélus. They had
	slouched along dead tired, drooping under their packs,
	sodden with mud and sleeplessness, silent, with not
	a note of a song among them—but at the entrance to
	the village, quickened by a word or two of exhortation
	from officers and sergeants, they pulled themselves
	together and marched in, heads up, forward, in faultless
	step. The C.O. was jealous of the honour of
	his men. He assumed that his predecessors in the
	village had been a “rotten lot,” and was determined
	to show the inhabitants of Frélus what a crack English
	regiment was really like. Frélus was an unimportant,
	unheard-of village; but the opinion of a thousand
	Fréluses made up France’s opinion of the British
	Army. Doggie, although half stupefied with fatigue,
	responded to the sentiment, like the rest. He was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"> </a>conscious of making part of a gallant show. It was
	only when they halted and stood easy that he lost
	count of things. The wide main street of the village
	swam characterless before his eyes. He followed, not
	directions, but directed men, with a sheep-like instinct,
	and found himself stumbling through an archway down
	a narrow path. He had a dim consciousness of lurching
	sideways and confusedly apologizing to a woman
	who supported him back to equilibrium. Then the
	next thing he saw was a barn full of fresh straw, and
	when somebody pointed to a vacant strip, he fell down,
	with many others, and went to sleep.</p>

	<p>The réveillé sounded a minute afterwards, though
	a whole night had passed; and there was the blessed
	clean water to wash in—he had long since ceased to
	be fastidious in his ablutions—and there was breakfast,
	sizzling bacon and bread and jam. And there
	in front of the kitchen, aiding with the hot water
	for the tea, moved a slim girl, with dark, and as Doggie
	thought, tragic eyes.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Kit inspection, feet inspection, all the duties of the
	day and dinner were over. Most of the men returned
	to their billets to sleep. Some, including Doggie,
	wandered about the village, taking the air, and
	visiting the little modest cafés and talking with indifferent
	success, so far as the interchange of articulate
	ideas was concerned, with shy children. McPhail
	and Mo Shendish being among the sleepers, Doggie
	mooned about by himself in his usual self-effacing
	way. There was little to interest him in the long
	straggling village. He had passed through a hundred
	such. Low whitewashed houses, interspersed with
	perky balconied buildings given over to little shops
	on the ground floor, with here and there a discreet
	<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"> </a>iron gate shutting off the doctor’s or the attorney’s
	villa, and bearing the oval plate indicating the name
	and pursuit of the tenant; here and there, too, long
	whitewashed walls enclosing a dairy or a timber-yard
	stretched on each side of the great high road,
	and the village gradually dwindled away at each end
	into the gently undulating country. There were just
	a by-lane or two, one leading up to the little grey
	church and presbytery and another to the little cemetery
	with its trim paths and black and white wooden
	crosses and wirework pious offerings. At open doors
	the British soldiers lounged at ease, and in the dim
	interiors behind them the forms of the women of
	the house, blue-aproned, moved to and fro. The
	early afternoon was warm, a westerly breeze deadened
	the sound of the distant bombardment to an unheeded
	drone, and a holy peace settled over the place.</p>

	<p>Doggie, clean, refreshed, comfortably drowsy,
	having explored the village, returned to his billet,
	and looking at it from the opposite side of the way,
	for the first time realized its nature. The lane,
	into which he had stumbled the night before, ran
	under an archway supporting some kind of overhead
	chamber, and separated the dwelling-house from a
	warehouse wall on which vast letters proclaimed the
	fact that Veuve Morin et Fils carried on therein the
	business of hay and corn dealers. Hence, Doggie
	reflected, the fresh, deep straw on which he and his
	fortunate comrades had wallowed. The double gate
	under the archway was held back by iron stanchions.
	The two-storied house looked fairly large and comfortable.
	The front door stood wide open, giving
	the view of a neat, stiff little hall or living-room.
	An article of furniture caught his idle eye. He
	crossed the road in order to have a nearer view. It
	<a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"> </a>was a huge polished mahogany cask standing about
	three feet high and bound with shining brass bands,
	such as he remembered having seen once in Brittany.
	He advanced still closer, and suddenly the slim, dark
	girl appeared and stood in the doorway, and looked
	frankly and somewhat rebukingly into his inquisitive
	eyes. Doggie flushed as one caught in an unmannerly
	act. A crying fault of the British Army is that it
	prescribes for the rank and file no form of polite
	recognition of the existence of civilians. It is contrary
	to Army Orders to salute or to take off their caps.
	They can only jerk their heads and grin, an inelegant
	proceeding, which places them at a disadvantage with
	the fair sex. Doggie, therefore, sketched a vague
	salutation half-way between a salute and a bow, and
	began a profuse apology. Mademoiselle must pardon
	his curiosity, but as a lover of old things he had been
	struck by the beautiful <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tonneau</em>.</p>

	<p>An amused light came into her sombre eyes and
	a smile flickered round her lips. Doggie noted instantly
	how pale she was, and how tiny, faint little lines
	persisted at the corners of those lips in spite of the smile.</p>

	<p>“There is no reason for excuses, monsieur,” she
	said. “The door was open to the view of everybody.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pourtant</em>,” said Doggie, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’était un peu mal élevé</em>.”</p>

	<p>She laughed. “Pardon. But it’s droll. First to
	find an English soldier apologizing for looking into
	a house, and then to find him talking French like a
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poilu</em>.”</p>

	<p>Doggie said, with a little touch of national jealousy
	and a reversion to Durdlebury punctilio: “I hope,
	mademoiselle, you have always found the English
	soldier conduct himself like a gentleman.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais oui, mais oui!</em>” she cried, “they are all
	charming. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils sont doux comme des moutons.</em> But
	<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"> </a>this is a question of delicacy—somewhat exaggerated.”</p>

	<p>“It’s good of you, mademoiselle, to forgive me,”
	said Doggie.</p>

	<p>By all the rules of polite intercourse, either Doggie
	should have made his bow and exit, or the maiden,
	exercising her prerogative, should have given him
	the opportunity of a graceful withdrawal. But they
	remained where they were, the girl framed by the
	doorway, the lithe little figure in khaki and lichen-coloured
	helmet looking up at her from the foot of
	the two front steps.</p>

	<p>At last he said in some embarrassment: “That’s
	a very beautiful cask of yours.”</p>

	<p>She wavered for a few seconds. Then she said:</p>

	<p>“You can enter, monsieur, and examine it, if you
	like.”</p>

	<p>Mademoiselle was very amiable, said Doggie.
	Mademoiselle moved aside and Doggie entered, taking
	off his helmet and holding it under his arm like
	an opera-hat. There was nothing much to see in
	the little vestibule-parlour: a stiff tasselled chair or
	two, a great old linen-press taking up most of one side
	of a wall, a cheap table covered with a chenille tablecloth,
	and the resplendent old cask, about which he
	lingered. He mentioned Brittany. Her tragic face
	lighted up again. Monsieur was right. Her aunt,
	Madame Morin, was Breton, and had brought the cask
	with her as part of her dowry, together with the press
	and other furniture. Doggie alluded to the vastly
	lettered inscription, “Veuve Morin et Fils.” Madame
	Morin was, in a sense, his hostess. And the sons?</p>

	<p>“One is in Madagascar, and the other—alas,
	monsieur!”</p>

	<p>And Doggie knew what that “alas!” meant.</p>

	<p>“The Argonne,” she said.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"> </a>“And madame your aunt?”</p>

	<p>She shrugged her thin though shapely shoulders.
	“It nearly killed her. She is old and an invalid.
	She has been in bed for the last three weeks.”</p>

	<p>“Then what becomes of the business?”</p>

	<p>“It is I, monsieur, who am the business. And I
	know nothing about it.” She sighed. Then with
	her blue apron—otherwise she was dressed in unrelieved
	black—she rubbed an imaginary speck from
	the brass banding of the cask. “This, I suppose
	you know, was for the best brandy, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>“And now?” he asked.</p>

	<p>“A memory. A sentiment. A thing of beauty.”</p>

	<p>In a feminine way, which he understood, she
	herded him to the door, by way of dismissal. Durdlebury
	helped him. A tiny French village has as many
	slanderous tongues as an English cathedral city. He
	was preparing to take polite leave, when she looked
	swiftly at him and made the faintest gesture of a
	detaining hand.</p>

	<p>“Now I remember. It was you who nearly fell
	into me last night, when you were entering through
	the gate.”</p>

	<p>The dim recollection came back—the firm woman’s
	arm round him for the few tottering seconds.</p>

	<p>“It seems I am always bound to be impolite, for
	I don’t think I thanked you,” smiled Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You were at the end of your tether.” Then
	very gently, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauvre garçon!</em>”</p>

	<p>“The <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sales Boches</em> had kept us awake for four
	nights,” said Doggie. “That was why.”</p>

	<p>“And you are rested now?”</p>

	<p>He laughed. “Almost.”</p>

	<p>They were at the door. He looked out and drew
	back. A knot of men were gathered by the gate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"> </a>of the yard. Apparently she had seen them too, for
	a flush rose to her pale cheeks.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle,” said Doggie, “I should like to
	creep back to the barn and sleep. If I pass my comrades
	they’ll want to detain me.”</p>

	<p>“That would be a pity,” she said demurely.
	“Come this way, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>She led him through a room and a passage to the
	kitchen. They shared a pleasurable sense of adventure
	and secrecy. At the kitchen door she paused and
	spoke to an old woman chopping up vegetables.</p>

	<p>“Toinette, let monsieur pass.” To Doggie she
	said: “Au revoir, monsieur!” and disappeared.</p>

	<p>The old woman looked at him at first with disfavour.
	She did not hold with Tommies needlessly
	tramping over the clean flags of her kitchen. But
	Doggie’s polite apology for disturbing her and a youthful
	grace of manner—he still held his tin hat under
	his arm—caused her features to relax.</p>

	<p>“You are English?”</p>

	<p>With a smile, he indicated his uniform. “Why,
	yes, madame.”</p>

	<p>“How comes it, then, that you speak French?”</p>

	<p>“Because I have always loved your beautiful
	France, madame.”</p>

	<p>“France—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ah! la pauvre France</em>!” She sighed,
	drew a wisp of what had been a cornet of snuff from
	her pocket, opened it, dipped in a tentative finger
	and thumb and, finding it empty, gazed at it with
	disappointment, sighed again and, with the methodical
	hopelessness of age, folded it up into the neatest of
	little squares and thrust it back in her pocket. Then
	she went on with her vegetables.</p>

	<p>Doggie took his leave and emerged into the yard.</p>

	<p>He dozed pleasantly on the straw of the barn, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"> </a>it was not the dead sleep of the night. Bits of his
	recent little adventure fitted into the semi-conscious
	intervals. He heard the girl’s voice saying so gently:
	“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauvre garçon!</em>” and it was very comforting.</p>

	<p>He was finally aroused by Phineas and Mo Shendish,
	who, having slept like tired dogs some distance off
	down the barn, now desired his company for a stroll
	round the village. Doggie good-naturedly assented.
	As they passed the house door he cast a quick glance.
	It was open, but the slim figure in black with the blue
	apron was not visible within. The shining cask, however,
	seemed to smile a friendly greeting.</p>

	<p>“If you believed the London papers,” said Phineas,
	“you’d think that the war-worn soldier coming from
	the trenches is met behind the lines with luxurious
	Turkish baths, comfortable warm canteens, picture
	palaces and theatrical entertainments. Can you perceive
	here any of those amenities of modern warfare?”</p>

	<p>They looked around them, and admitted they
	could not.</p>

	<p>“Apparently,” said Phineas, “the Colonel, good but
	limited man, has missed all the proper places and dumps
	us in localities unrecognized by the London Press.”</p>

	<p>“Put me on the pier at Brighton,” sang Mo
	Shendish. “But I’d sooner have Margit or Yarmouth
	any day. Brighton’s too toffish for whelks.
	My! and cockles! I wonder whether we shall ever
	eat ’em again.” A far-away, dreamy look crept into
	his eyes.</p>

	<p>“Does your young lady like cockles?” Doggie
	asked sympathetically.</p>

	<p>“Aggie? Funny thing, I was just thinking of
	her. She fair dotes on ’em. We had a day at Southend
	just before the war——”</p>

	<p>He launched into anecdote. His companions
	<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"> </a>listened, Phineas ironically carrying out his theory of
	adaptability, Doggie with finer instinct. It appeared
	there had been an altercation over right of choice
	with an itinerant vendor in which, to Aggie’s admiration,
	Mo had come off triumphant.</p>

	<p>“You see,” he explained, “being in the fish trade
	myself, I could spot the winners.”</p>

	<p>James Marmaduke Trevor, of Denby Hall, laughed
	and slapped him on the back, and said indulgently:
	“Good old Mo!”</p>

	<p>At the little school-house they stopped to gossip
	with some of their friends who were billeted there,
	and they sang the praises of the Veuve Morin’s barn.</p>

	<p>“I wonder you don’t have the house full of orficers,
	if it’s so wonderful,” said some one.</p>

	<p>An omniscient corporal in the confidence of the
	quartermaster explained that the landlady being ill in
	bed, and the place run by a young girl, the house
	had been purposely missed. Doggie drew a breath of
	relief at the news and attributed Madame Morin’s
	malady to the intervention of a kindly providence.
	Somehow he did not fancy officers having the run of
	the house.</p>

	<p>They strolled on and came to a forlorn little <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Débit
	de Tabac</em>, showing in its small window some clay
	pipes and a few fly-blown picture post-cards. Now
	Doggie, in spite of his training in adversity, had never
	resigned himself to “Woodbines,” and other such
	brands supplied to the British Army, and Egyptian
	and Turkish being beyond his social pale, he had taken
	to smoking French Régie tobacco, of which he laid
	in a stock whenever he had the chance. So now he
	entered the shop, leaving Phineas and Mo outside.
	As they looked on French cigarettes with sturdy
	British contempt, they were not interested in Doggie’s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"> </a>purchases. A wan girl of thirteen rose from behind
	the counter.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous désirez, monsieur?</em>”</p>

	<p>Doggie stated his desire. The girl was calculating
	the price of the packets before wrapping them up,
	when his eyes fell upon a neat little pile of cornets
	in a pigeon-hole at the back. They directly suggested
	to him one of the great luminous ideas of his life.
	It was only afterwards that he realized its effulgence.
	For the moment he was merely concerned with the
	needs of a poor old woman who had sighed lamentably
	over an empty paper of comfort.</p>

	<p>“Do you sell snuff?”</p>

	<p>“But yes, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>“Give me some of the best quality.”</p>

	<p>“How much does monsieur desire?”</p>

	<p>“A lot,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>And he bought a great package, enough to set the
	whole village sneezing to the end of the war, and peering
	round the tiny shop and espying in the recesses
	of a glass case a little olive-wood box ornamented
	on the top with pansies and forget-me-nots, purchased
	that also. He had just paid when his companions put
	their heads in the doorway. Mo, pointing waggishly
	to Doggie, warned the little girl against his depravity.</p>

	<p>“Mauvy, mauvy!” said he.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu’est-ce qu’il dit?</em>” asked the child.</p>

	<p>“He’s the idiot of the regiment, whom I have to
	look after and feed with pap,” said Doggie, “and,
	being hungry, he is begging you not to detain me.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em>” cried the child.</p>

	<p>Doggie, always courteous, went out with a “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
	soir, mademoiselle</em>,” and joined his friends.</p>

	<p>“What were you jabbering to her about?” Mo
	asked suspiciously.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"> </a>Doggie gave him the literal translation of his speech.
	Phineas burst into loud laughter.</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said he, “I’ve never heard you make
	a joke before. The idiot of the regiment, and you’re
	his keeper! Man, that’s fine. What has come over
	you to-day?”</p>

	<p>“If he’d said a thing like that in Mare Street,
	Hackney, I’d have knocked his blinking ’ead orf,”
	declared Mo Shendish.</p>

	<p>Doggie stopped and put his parcel-filled hands
	behind his back.</p>

	<p>“Have a try now, Mo.”</p>

	<p>But Mo bade him fry his ugly face, and thus established
	harmony.</p>

	<p>It was late that evening before Doggie could find
	an opportunity of slipping, unobserved, through the
	open door into the house kitchen dimly illuminated
	by an oil lamp.</p>

	<p>“Madame,” said he to Toinette, “I observed to-day
	that you had come to the end of your snuff. Will
	you permit a little English soldier to give you some?
	Also a little box to keep it in.”</p>

	<p>The old woman, spare, myriad-wrinkled beneath
	her peasant’s <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffe</em>, yet looking as if carved out of
	weather-beaten oak, glanced from the gift to the
	donor and from the donor to the gift.</p>

	<p>“But, monsieur—monsieur—why?” she began
	quaveringly.</p>

	<p>“You surely have some one—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">là bas</em>—over yonder?”
	said Doggie with a sweep of his hand.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais oui?</em> How did you know? My grandson.
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon petiot</em>——”</p>

	<p>“It is he, my comrade, who sends the snuff to
	the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand’mére</em>.” And Doggie bolted.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XIII"><a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">At</span> breakfast next morning Doggie searched the
	courtyard in vain for the slim figure of the
	girl. Yesterday she had stood just outside the kitchen
	door. To-day her office was usurped by a hefty
	cook with the sleeves of his grey shirt rolled up and
	his collar open and vast and tight-hitched braces
	unromantically strapped all over him. Doggie
	felt a pang of disappointment and abused the tea.
	Mo Shendish stared, and asked what was wrong
	with it.</p>

	<p>“Rotten,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You can’t expect yer slap-up City A.B.C. shops
	in France,” said Mo.</p>

	<p>Doggie, who was beginning to acquire a sense of
	rueful humour, smiled and was appeased.</p>

	<p>It was only in the afternoon that he saw the girl
	again. She was standing in the doorway of the house,
	with her hand on her bosom, as though she had just
	come out to breathe fresh air, when Doggie and his
	two friends emerged from the yard. As their eyes
	met, she greeted him with her sad little smile. Emboldened,
	he stepped forward.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon jour, mademoiselle.</em>”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon jour, monsieur.</em>”</p>

	<p>“I hope madame your aunt is better to-day.”</p>

	<p>She seemed to derive some dry amusement from
	his solicitude.</p>

	<p>“Alas, no, monsieur.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"> </a>“Was that why I had not the pleasure of seeing
	you this morning?”</p>

	<p>“Where?”</p>

	<p>“Yesterday you filled our tea-kettles.”</p>

	<p>“But, monsieur,” she replied primly, “I am not
	the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivandière</em> of the regiment.”</p>

	<p>“That’s a pity,” laughed Doggie.</p>

	<p>Then he became aware of the adjacent forms and
	staring eyes of Phineas and Mo, who for the first
	time in their military career beheld him on easy terms
	with a strange and prepossessing young woman. After
	a second’s thought he came to a diplomatic decision.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle,” said he, in his best Durdlebury
	manner, “may I dare to present my two comrades,
	my best friends in the battalion, Monsieur McPhail,
	Monsieur Shendish?”</p>

	<p>She made them each a little formal bow, and then,
	somewhat maliciously, addressing McPhail, as the
	bigger and the elder of the two:</p>

	<p>“I don’t yet know the name of your friend.”</p>

	<p>Phineas put his great hand on Doggie’s shoulder.</p>

	<p>“James Marmaduke Trevor.”</p>

	<p>“Otherwise called Doggie, miss,” said Mo.</p>

	<p>She made a little graceful gesture of non-comprehension.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non compree?</em>” asked Mo.</p>

	<p>“No, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>Phineas explained, in his rasping and consciously
	translated French:</p>

	<p>“It is a nickname of the regiment. Doggie.”</p>

	<p>The flushed and embarrassed subject of the discussion
	saw her lips move silently to the word.</p>

	<p>“But his name is Trevor. Monsieur Trevor,”
	said Phineas.</p>

	<p>She smiled again. And the strange thing about
	<a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"> </a>her smile was that it was a matter of her lips and rarely
	of her eyes, which always maintained the haunting
	sadness of their tragic depths.</p>

	<p>“Monsieur Trevor,” she repeated imitatively.
	“And yours, monsieur?”</p>

	<p>“McPhail.”</p>

	<p>“Mac-Fêle; <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est assez difficile</em>. And yours?”</p>

	<p>Mo guessed. “Shendish,” said he.</p>

	<p>She repeated that also, whereat Mo grinned fatuously,
	showing his little yellow teeth beneath his scrubby
	red moustache.</p>

	<p>“My friends call me Mo,” said he.</p>

	<p>She grasped his meaning. “Mo,” she said; and
	she said it so funnily and softly, and with ever so
	little a touch of quizzicality, that the sentimental
	warrior roared with delight.</p>

	<p>“You’ve got it right fust time, miss.”</p>

	<p>From her two steps’ height of vantage, she looked
	down on the three upturned British faces—and her
	eyes went calmly from one to the other.</p>

	<p>She turned to Doggie. “One would say, monsieur,
	that you were the Three Musketeers.”</p>

	<p>“Possibly, mademoiselle,” laughed Doggie. He
	had not felt so light-hearted for many months. “But
	we lack a d’Artagnan.”</p>

	<p>“When you find him, bring him to me,” said the
	girl.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle,” said Phineas gallantly, “we
	would not be such imbeciles.”</p>

	<p>At that moment the voice of Toinette came from
	within.</p>

	<p>“Ma’amselle Jeanne!  Ma’amselle Jeanne!”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui, j’y viens</em>,” she cried. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon soir, messieurs</em>,”
	and she was gone.</p>

	<p>Doggie looked into the empty vestibule and smiled
	<a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"> </a>at the friendly brandy cask. Provided it is pronounced
	correctly, so as to rhyme with the English “Anne,”
	it is a very pretty name. Doggie thought she
	looked like Jeanne—a Jeanne d’Arc of this modern
	war.</p>

	<p>“Yon’s a very fascinating lassie,” Phineas remarked
	soberly, as they started on their stroll. “Did you
	happen to observe that all the time she was talking so
	prettily she was looking at ghosts behind us?”</p>

	<p>“Do you think so?” asked Doggie, startled.</p>

	<p>“Man, I know it,” replied Phineas.</p>

	<p>“Ghosts be blowed!” cried Mo Shendish. “She’s
	a bit of orl right, she is. What I call class. Doesn’t
	chuck ’erself at yer ’ead, like some of ’em, and, on
	the other ’and, has none of yer blooming stand-orfishness.
	See what I mean?” He clutched them
	each by an arm—he was between them. “Look
	’ere. How do you think I could pick up this blinking
	lingo—quick?”</p>

	<p>“Make violent love to Toinette and ask her to
	teach you. There’s nothing like it,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Who’s Toinette?”</p>

	<p>“The nice old lady in the kitchen.”</p>

	<p>Mo flung his arm away. “Oh, go and boil
	yourself!” said he.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">But the making of love to the old woman in the
	kitchen led to possibilities of which Mo Shendish
	never dreamed. They never dawned on Doggie
	until he found himself at it that evening.</p>

	<p>It was dusk. The men were lounging and smoking
	about the courtyard. Doggie, who had long since
	exchanged poor Taffy Jones’s imperfect penny whistle
	for a scientific musical instrument ordered from
	Bond Street, was playing, with his sensitive skill, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"> </a>airs they loved. He had just finished “Annie Laurie”—“Man,”
	Phineas used to declare, “when Doggie
	Trevor plays ‘Annie Laurie,’ he has the power to
	take your heart by the strings and drag it out through
	your eyes”—he had just come to the end of this
	popular and gizzard-piercing tune and received his
	meed of applause, when Toinette came out of the
	kitchen, two great zinc crocks in her hands, and
	crossed to the pump in the corner of the yard. Three
	or four would-be pumpers, among them Doggie, went
	to her aid.</p>

	<p>“All right, mother, we’ll see to it,” said one of
	them.</p>

	<p>So they pumped and filled the crocks, and one
	man got hold of one and Doggie got hold of another,
	and they carried them to the kitchen steps.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, monsieur</em>,” said Toinette to the first; and
	he went away with a friendly nod. But to Doggie
	she said, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Entrez, monsieur</em>.” And monsieur carried
	the two crocks over the threshold and Toinette shut
	the door behind him. And there, sitting over some
	needlework in a corner of the kitchen by a lamp, sat
	Jeanne.</p>

	<p>She looked up rather startled, frowned for the
	brief part of a second, and regarded him inquiringly.</p>

	<p>“I brought in monsieur to show him the photograph
	of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon petiot</em>, the comrade who sent me the snuff,”
	explained Toinette, rummaging in a cupboard.</p>

	<p>“May I stay and look at it?” asked Doggie,
	buttoning up his tunic.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais parfaitement, monsieur</em>,” said Jeanne. “It
	is Toinette’s kitchen.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien sûr</em>,” said the old woman, turning with the
	photograph, that of a solid young infantryman. Doggie
	made polite remarks. Toinette put on a pair of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"> </a>silver-rimmed spectacles and scanned the picture.
	Then she handed it to Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you think there is a great deal of resemblance?”</p>

	<p>Jeanne directed a comparing glance at Doggie
	and smiled.</p>

	<p>“Like two little soldiers in a pod,” she said.</p>

	<p>Toinette talked of her <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petiot</em> who was at St. Mihiel.
	It was far away, very far. She sighed as though he
	were fighting remote in the Caucasus.</p>

	<p>Presently came the sharp ring of a bell. Jeanne
	put aside her work and rose.</p>

	<p>“It is my aunt who has awakened.”</p>

	<p>But Toinette was already at the door. “I will go
	up, Ma’amselle Jeanne. Do not derange yourself.”</p>

	<p>She bustled away. Once more the pair found
	themselves alone together.</p>

	<p>“If you don’t continue your sewing, mademoiselle,”
	said Doggie, “I shall think that I am disturbing you,
	and must bid you good night.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne sat down and resumed her work. A
	sensation, more like laughter than anything else,
	fluttered round Doggie’s heart.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voulez-vous vous asseoir, Monsieur—Trevor?</em>”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous êtes bien aimable, Mademoiselle Jeanne</em>,”
	said Doggie, sitting down on a straight-backed chair
	by the oilcloth-covered kitchen table which was
	between them.</p>

	<p>“May I move the lamp slightly?” he asked,
	for it hid her from his view.</p>

	<p>He moved it somewhat to her left. It threw
	shadows over her features, accentuating their appealing
	sadness. He watched her, and thought of McPhail’s
	words about the ghosts. He noted too, as the needle
	went in and out of the fabric, that her hands, though
	<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"> </a>roughened by coarse work, were finely made, with
	long fingers and delicate wrists. He broke a silence
	that grew embarrassing.</p>

	<p>“You seem to have suffered greatly, Mademoiselle
	Jeanne,” he said softly.</p>

	<p>Her lips quivered. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais oui, monsieur.</em>”</p>

	<p>“Monsieur Trevor,” he said.</p>

	<p>She put her hands and needlework in her lap and
	looked at him full.</p>

	<p>“And you too have suffered?”</p>

	<p>“I? Oh no.”</p>

	<p>“But, yes. I have seen too much of it not to know.
	I see in the eyes. Your two comrades to-day—they
	are good fellows—but they have not suffered.
	You are different.”</p>

	<p>“Not a bit,” he declared. “We’re just little
	indistinguishable bits of the conglomerate Tommy.”</p>

	<p>“And I, monsieur, have the honour to say that you
	are different.”</p>

	<p>This was very flattering. More—it was sweet
	unction, grateful to many a bruise.</p>

	<p>“How?” said he.</p>

	<p>“You do not belong to their world. Your Tommies
	are wonderful in their kindness and chivalry—until
	I met them I had never seen an Englishman in
	my life—I had imbecile ideas—I thought they would
	be without manners—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un peu insultants</em>. I found I
	could walk among them, without fear, as if I were a
	princess. It is true.”</p>

	<p>“It is because you have the air of a princess,”
	said Doggie; “a sad little disguised princess of a
	fairy-tale, who is recognized by all the wild boars
	and rabbits in the wood.”</p>

	<p>She glanced aside. “There isn’t a woman in
	Frélus who is differently treated. I am only an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"> </a>ignorant girl, half bourgeoise, half peasant, monsieur,
	but I have my woman’s knowledge—and I know
	there is a difference between you and the others.
	You are a son of good family. It is evident. You
	have a delicacy of mind and of feeling. You were
	not born to be a soldier.”</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle Jeanne,” cried Doggie, “do I
	appear as bad as that? Do you take me for an
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embusqué manqué</em>?”</p>

	<p>Now an <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embusqué</em> is a slacker who lies in the safe
	ambush of a soft job. And an <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embusqué manqué</em> is a
	slacker who fortuitously has failed to win the fungus
	wreath of slackerdom.</p>

	<p>She flushed deep red.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne suis pas malhonnête, monsieur.</em>”</p>

	<p>Doggie spread himself elbow-wise over the table.
	The girl’s visible register of moods was fascinating.</p>

	<p>“Pardon, Mademoiselle Jeanne. You are quite
	right. But it’s not a question of what I was born
	to be—but what I was trained to be. I wasn’t
	trained to be a soldier. But I do my best.”</p>

	<p>She looked at him waveringly.</p>

	<p>“Forgive me, mademoiselle.”</p>

	<p>“But you flash out on the point of honour.”</p>

	<p>Doggie laughed. “Which shows that I have the
	essential of the soldier.”</p>

	<p>Doggie’s manner was not without charm. She
	relented.</p>

	<p>“You know very well what I mean,” she said
	rebukingly. “And you don’t deserve that I should
	tell it to you. It was my intention to say that you
	have sacrificed many things to make yourself a simple
	soldier.”</p>

	<p>“Only a few idle habits,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You joined, like the rest, as a volunteer.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"> </a>“Of course.”</p>

	<p>“You abandoned everything to fight for your
	country?”</p>

	<p>Under the spell of her dark eyes Doggie spoke
	according to Phineas after the going West of Taffy
	Jones, “I think, Mademoiselle Jeanne, it was rather
	to fight for my soul.”</p>

	<p>She resumed her sewing. “That’s what I meant
	long ago,” she remarked with the first draw of the
	needle. “No one could fight for his soul without
	passing through suffering.” She went on sewing.
	Doggie, shrinking from a reply that might have sounded
	fatuous, remained silent; but he realized a wonderful
	faculty of comprehension in Jeanne.</p>

	<p>After awhile he said: “Where did you learn all
	your wisdom, Mademoiselle Jeanne?”</p>

	<p>“At the convent, I suppose. My father gave me
	a good education.”</p>

	<p>“An English poet has said, ‘Knowledge comes,
	but Wisdom lingers’”—Doggie had rather a fight to
	express the meaning exactly in French—“You don’t
	gather wisdom in convents.”</p>

	<p>“It is true. Since then I have seen many things.”</p>

	<p>She stared across the room, not at Doggie, and he
	thought again of the ghosts.</p>

	<p>“Tell me some of them, Mademoiselle Jeanne,”
	he said in a low voice.</p>

	<p>She shot a swift glance at him and met his honest
	brown eyes.</p>

	<p>“I saw my father murdered in front of me,” she said
	in a harsh voice.</p>

	<p>“My God!” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“It was on the Retreat. We lived in Cambrai,
	my father and mother and I. He was a lawyer.
	When we heard the Germans were coming, my
	<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"> </a>father, somewhat of an invalid, decided to fly. He
	had heard of what they had already done in Belgium.
	We tried to go by train. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas moyen.</em> We took to
	the road, with many others. We could not get a
	horse—we had postponed our flight till too late.
	Only a handcart, with a few necessaries and precious
	things. And we walked until we nearly died of
	heat and dust and grief. For our hearts were very
	heavy, monsieur. The roads, too, were full of the
	English in retreat. I shall not tell you what I saw
	of the wounded by the roadside. I sometimes see
	them now in my dreams. And we were helpless.
	We thought we would leave the main roads, and at
	last we got lost and found ourselves in a little wood.
	We sat down to rest and to eat. It was cool and
	pleasant, and I laughed, to cheer my parents, for they
	knew how I loved to eat under the freshness of the
	trees.” She shivered. “I hope I shall never have to
	eat a meal in a wood again. We had scarcely begun
	when a body of cavalry, with strange pointed helmets,
	rode along the path and, seeing us, halted. My
	mother, half dead with terror, cried out, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu,
	ce sont des Uhlans!</em>’ The leader, I suppose an officer,
	called out something in German. My father replied.
	I do not understand German, so I did not know and
	shall never know what they said. But my father
	protested in anger and stood in front of the horse
	making gestures. And then the officer took out his
	revolver and shot him through the heart, and he fell
	dead. And the murderer turned his horse’s head
	round and he laughed. He laughed, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>“Damn him!” said Doggie, in English. “Damn
	him!”</p>

	<p>He gazed deep into Jeanne’s dark tearless eyes.
	She continued in the same even voice:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"> </a>“My mother became mad. She was a peasant, a
	Bretonne, where the blood is fierce, and she screamed
	and clung to the bridle of the horse. And he rode
	her down and the horse trampled on her. Then he
	pointed at me, who was supporting the body of my
	father, and three men dismounted. But suddenly
	he heard something, gave an order, and the men
	mounted again, and they all rode away laughing and
	jeering, and the last man, in bad French, shouted at
	me a foul insult. And I was there, Monsieur Trevor,
	with my father dead and my mother stunned and
	bruised and bleeding.”</p>

	<p>Doggie, sensitive, quivered to the girl’s tragedy:
	he said, with tense face:</p>

	<p>“God give me strength to kill every German I
	see!”</p>

	<p>She nodded slowly. “No German is a human
	being. If I were God, I would exterminate the
	accursed race like wolves.”</p>

	<p>“You are right,” said Doggie. A short silence
	fell. He asked: “What happened then?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu</em>, I almost forget. I was overwhelmed
	with grief and horror. Some hours afterwards a
	small body of English infantry came—many of them
	had bloodstained bandages. An officer who spoke
	a little French questioned me. I told him what had
	happened. He spoke with another officer, and
	because I recognized the word ‘Uhlans,’ I knew they
	were anxious about the patrol. They asked me the
	way to some place—I forget where. But I was
	lost. They looked at a map. Meanwhile my
	mother had recovered consciousness. I gave her a
	little wine from the bottle we had opened for our
	repast. I happened to look at the officer and saw
	him pass his tongue over his cracked lips. All the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"> </a>men had thrown themselves down by the side of the
	road. I handed him the bottle and the little tin
	cup. To my surprise, he did not drink. He said:
	‘Mademoiselle, this is war, and we are all in very
	great peril. My men are dying of thirst, and if you
	have any more of the wine, give it to them and they
	will do their utmost to conduct your mother and yourself
	to a place of safety.’ Alas! there were only
	three bottles in our little basket of provisions. Naturally
	I gave it all—together with the food. He called
	a sergeant, who took the provisions and distributed
	them, while I was tending my mother. But I noticed
	that the two officers took neither bite nor sup. It was
	only afterwards, Monsieur Trevor, that I realized I
	had seen your great English gentlemen…. Then
	they dug a little grave, for my father…. It was
	soon finished … the danger was grave … and
	some soldiers took a rope and pulled the handcart,
	with my mother lying on top of our little possessions,
	and I walked with them, until the whole of my life
	was blotted out with fatigue. We got on to the
	Route Nationale again and mingled again with the
	Retreat. And in the night, as we were still marching,
	there was a halt. I went to my mother. She was
	cold, monsieur, cold and stiff. She was dead.”</p>

	<p>She paused tragically. After a few moments she
	continued:</p>

	<p>“I fainted. I do not know what happened till
	I recovered consciousness at dawn. I found myself
	wrapped in one of our blankets, lying under the
	handcart. It was the market-square of a little town.
	And there were many—old men and women and
	children, refugees like me. I rose and found a paper—a
	leaf torn from a notebook—fixed to the handcart.
	It was from the officer, bidding me farewell. Military
	<a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"> </a>necessity forced him to go on with his men—but
	he had kept his word, and brought me to a place of
	safety…. That is how I first met the English,
	Monsieur Trevor. They had carried me, I suppose,
	on the handcart, all night, they who were broken
	with weariness. I owe them my life and my reason.”</p>

	<p>“And your mother?”</p>

	<p>“How should I know? <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est restée là-bas</em>,”
	she replied simply.</p>

	<p>She went on with her sewing. Doggie wondered
	how her hand could be so steady. There was a
	long silence. What words, save vain imprecations
	on the accursed race, were adequate? Presently her
	glance rested for a second or two on his sensitive face.</p>

	<p>“Why do you not smoke, Monsieur Trevor?”</p>

	<p>“May I?”</p>

	<p>“Of course. It calms the nerves. I ought not
	to have saddened you with my griefs.”</p>

	<p>Doggie took out his pink packet and lit a cigarette.</p>

	<p>“You are very understanding, Mademoiselle
	Jeanne. But it does a selfish man like me good to
	be saddened by a story like yours. I have not had
	much opportunity in my life of feeling for another’s
	suffering. And since the war—I am <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abruti</em>.”</p>

	<p>“You? Do you think if I had not found you
	just the reverse, I should have told you all this?”</p>

	<p>“You have paid me a great compliment, Mademoiselle
	Jeanne.” Then, after awhile, he asked,
	“From the market-square of the little town you found
	means to come here?”</p>

	<p>“Alas, no!” she said, putting her work in her
	lap again. “I made my way, with my handcart—it
	was easy—to our original destination, a little farm
	belonging to the eldest brother of my father. The
	Farm of La Folette. He lived there alone, a widower,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186"> </a>with his farm-servants. He had no children. We
	thought we were safe. Alas! news came that the
	Germans were always advancing. We had time to
	fly. All the farm-hands fled, except Père Grigou,
	who loved him. But my uncle was obstinate. To
	a Frenchman, the soil he possesses is his flesh and his
	blood. He would die rather than leave it. And my
	uncle had the murder of my father and mother on his
	brain. He told Père Grigou to take me away, but
	I stayed with him. It was Père Grigou who forced
	us to hide. That lasted two days. There was a
	well in the farm, and one night Père Grigou tied up
	my money and my mother’s jewellery and my father’s
	papers, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfin</em>, all the precious things we had, in a packet
	of waterproof and sank it with a long string down the
	well, so that the Germans could not find it. It was
	foolish, but he insisted. One day my uncle and
	Père Grigou went out of the little copse where we
	had been hiding, in order to reconnoitre, for he thought
	the Germans might be going away; and my uncle,
	who would not listen to me, took his gun. Presently
	I heard a shot—and then another. You can guess
	what it meant. And soon Père Grigou came, white
	and shaking with terror. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il en a tué un, et on l’a
	tué!</em>’”</p>

	<p>“My God!” said Doggie again.</p>

	<p>“It was terrible,” she said. “But they were in
	their right.”</p>

	<p>“And then?”</p>

	<p>“We lay hidden until it was dark—how they did
	not find us I don’t know—and then we escaped across
	country. I thought of coming here to my Aunt
	Morin, which is not far from La Folette, but I reflected
	that soon the Boches would be here also. And we
	went on. We got to a high road—and once more
	<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"> </a>I was among troops and refugees. I met some kind
	folks in a carriage, a Monsieur and Madame Tarride,
	and they took me in. And so I got to Paris, where I
	had the hospitality of a friend of the Convent who was
	married.”</p>

	<p>“And Père Grigou?”</p>

	<p>“He insisted on going back to bury my uncle.
	Nothing could move him. He had not parted from
	him all his life. They were foster-brothers. Where
	he is now, who knows?” She paused, looked again
	at her ghosts, and continued: “That is all, Monsieur
	Trevor. The Germans passed through here and
	repassed on their retreat, and, as soon as it was safe, I
	came to help my aunt, who was <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souffrante</em>, and had lost
	her son. Also because I could not live on charity
	on my friend, for, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyez-vous</em>, I was without a sou—all
	my money having been hidden in the well by
	Père Grigou.”</p>

	<p>Doggie leant his elbows on the table.</p>

	<p>“And you have come through all that, Mademoiselle
	Jeanne, just as you are——?”</p>

	<p>“How, just as I am?”</p>

	<p>“So gentle and kind and comprehending?”</p>

	<p>Her cheek flushed. “I am not the only Frenchwoman
	who has passed through such things and kept
	herself proud. But the struggle has been very hard.”</p>

	<p>Doggie rose and clenched his fists and rubbed his
	head from front to back in his old indecisive way, and
	began to swear incoherently in English. She smiled
	sadly.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, mon pauvre ami!</em>”</p>

	<p>He wheeled round: “Why do you call me ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon
	pauvre ami</em>’?”</p>

	<p>“Because I see that you would like to help me and
	you can’t.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188"> </a>“Jeanne,” cried Doggie, bending half over the
	table which was between them.</p>

	<p>She rose too, startled, on quick defensive. He said,
	in reply to her glance:</p>

	<p>“Why shouldn’t I call you Jeanne?”</p>

	<p>“You haven’t the right.”</p>

	<p>“What if I gain it?”</p>

	<p>“How?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>The door burst suddenly open and the anxious face
	of Mo Shendish appeared.</p>

	<p>“’Ere, you silly cuckoo, don’t yer know you’re
	on guard to-night? You’ve just got about thirty
	seconds.”</p>

	<p>“Good lord!” cried Doggie, “I forgot. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
	soir, mademoiselle. Service militaire</em>,” and he rushed
	out.</p>

	<p>Mo lingered, with a grin, and jerked a backward
	thumb.</p>

	<p>“If it weren’t for old Mo, miss, I don’t know
	what would happen to our friend Doggie. I got to
	look after him like a baby, I ’ave. He’s on to relieve
	guard, and if old Mac—that’s McPhail”—she nodded
	recognition of the name—“and I hadn’t remembered,
	miss, he’d ’ave been in what yer might call a ’ole.
	Compree?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui.</em> Yes,” she said. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde. Sentinelle.</em>”</p>

	<p>“Sentinel. Sentry. Right.”</p>

	<p>“He—was—late,” she said, picking out her few
	English words from memory.</p>

	<p>“Yuss,” grinned Mo.</p>

	<p>“He—guard—house?”</p>

	<p>“Bless you, miss, you talk English as well as I
	do,” cried the admiring Mo. “Yuss. When his
	turn comes, up and down in the street, by the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"> </a>gate.” He saw her puzzled look. “Roo. Port,”
	said he.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! oui, je comprends</em>,” smiled Jeanne. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci,
	monsieur, et bon soir.</em>”</p>

	<p>“Good night, miss,” said Mo.</p>

	<p>Some time later he disturbed Phineas, by whose side
	he slept, from his initial preparation for slumber.</p>

	<p>“Mac! Is there any book I could learn this
	blinking lingo from?”</p>

	<p>“Try Ovid—‘Art of Love,’” replied Phineas
	sleepily.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XIV"><a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> spell of night sentry duty had always been
	Doggie’s black hour. To most of the other
	military routine he had grown hardened or deadened.
	In the depths of his heart he hated the life as much as
	ever. He had schooled himself to go through it
	with the dull fatalism of a convict. It was no use
	railing at inexorable laws, irremediable conditions.
	The only alternative to the acceptance of his position
	was military punishment, which was far worse—to
	say nothing of the outrage to his pride. It was pride
	that kept the little ironical smile on his lips while his
	nerves were almost breaking with strain. The first
	time he came under fire he was physically sick—not
	from fear, for he stood it better than most, keeping an
	eye on his captain, whose function it was to show an
	unconcerned face—but from sheer nervous reaction
	against the hideous noise, the stench, the ghastly upheaval
	of the earth, the sight of mangled men. When
	the bombardment was over, if he had been alone, he
	would have sat down and cried. Never had he grown
	accustomed to the foulness of the trenches. The
	sounder his physical condition, the more did his
	delicately trained senses revolt. It was only when
	fierce animal cravings dulled these senses that he could
	throw himself down anywhere and sleep, that he could
	swallow anything in the way of food or drink. The
	rats nearly drove him crazy…. Yet, what had
	once been to him a torture, the indecent, nerve-rasping
	<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191"> </a>publicity of the soldier’s life, had now become a
	compensation. It was not so much in companionship,
	like his friendly intercourse with Phineas and Mo,
	that he found an anodyne, but in the consciousness of
	being magnetically affected by the crowd of his fellows.
	They offered him protection against himself. Whatever
	pangs of self-pity he felt, whatever wan little
	pleadings for the bit of fine porcelain compelled to a
	rough usage which vessels of coarser clay could disregard
	came lingeringly into his mind, he dared not
	express them to a living soul around. On the contrary,
	he set himself assiduously to cultivate the earthenware
	habit of spirit; not to feel, not to think, only
	to endure. To a humorously incredulous Jeanne he
	proclaimed himself <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abruti</em>. Finally, the ceaseless grind
	of the military machine left him little time to think.</p>

	<p>But in the solitary sleepless hours of sentry duty
	there was nothing to do but think; nothing wherewith
	to while away the time but an orgy of introspection.
	First came the almost paralysing sense of responsibility.
	He must keep, not only awake, but alert to the slightest
	sound, the slightest movement. Lives of men depended
	on his vigilance. A man can’t screw himself up to
	this beautifully emotional pitch for very long and be
	an efficient sentry. If he did, he would challenge
	mice and shoot at cloud-shadows and bring the deuce
	of a commotion about his ears. And this Doggie,
	who did not lack ordinary intelligence, realized. So
	he strove to think of other things. And the other
	things all focussed down upon his Doggie self. And
	he never knew what to make of his Doggie self at all.
	For he would curse the things that he once loved as
	being the cause of his inexpiable shame, and at the same
	time yearn for them with an agony of longing.</p>

	<p>And he would force himself to think of Peggy and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192"> </a>her unswerving loyalty. Of her weekly parcel of
	dainty food, which had arrived that morning. Of
	the joy of Phineas and the disappointment of the
	unsophisticated Mo over the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté de foie gras</em>. But
	his mind wandered back to his Doggie self and its
	humiliations and its needs and its yearnings. He
	welcomed enemy flares and star-shells and excursions
	and alarms. They kept him from thinking, enabled
	him to pass the time. But in the dead, lonely, silent
	dark, the hours were like centuries. He dreaded them.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">To-night they fled like minutes. It was a pitch-black
	night, spitting fine rain. It was one of Doggie’s
	private grievances that it invariably rained when he
	was on sentry duty. One of Heaven’s little ways of
	strafing him for Doggieism. But to-night he did not
	heed it. Often the passage of transport had been a
	distraction for which he had longed and which, when
	it came, was warmly welcome. But to-night, during
	his spell, the roadway of the village was as still as death,
	and he loved the stillness and the blackness. Once he
	had welcomed familiar approaching steps. Now he
	resented them.</p>

	<p>“Who goes there?”</p>

	<p>“Rounds.”</p>

	<p>And the officer, recognized, flashing an electric
	torch, passed on. The diminuendo of his footsteps
	was agreeable to Doggie’s ear. The rain dripped
	monotonously off his helmet on to his sodden shoulders,
	but Doggie did not mind. Now and then he strained
	an eye upwards to that part of the living-house that was
	above the gateway. Little streaks of light came downwards
	through the shutter slats. Now it required
	no great intellectual effort to surmise that the light
	proceeded, not from the bedroom of the invalid
	<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193"> </a>Madame Morin, who would naturally have the best
	bedroom situated in the comfortable main block of
	the house, but from that of somebody else. Madame
	Morin was therefore ruled out. So was Toinette—ridiculous
	to think of her keeping all night vigil.
	There remained only Jeanne.</p>

	<p>It was supremely silly of him to march with super-martiality
	of tread up the pavement; but then, it is often
	the way of young men to do supremely silly things.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The next day was fuss and bustle, from the private
	soldier’s point of view. They were marching back to the
	trenches that night, and a crack company must take
	over with flawless equipment and in flawless bodily
	health. In the afternoon Doggie had a breathing spell
	of leisure. He walked boldly into the kitchen.</p>

	<p>“Madame,” said he to Toinette, “I suppose you
	know that we are leaving to-night?”</p>

	<p>The old woman sighed. “It is always like that.
	They come, they make friends, they go, and they
	never return.”</p>

	<p>“You mustn’t make the little soldier weep, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand’mère</em>,”
	said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“No. It is the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand’mères</em> who weep,” replied
	Toinette.</p>

	<p>“I’ll come back all right,” said he. “Where is
	Mademoiselle Jeanne?”</p>

	<p>“She is upstairs, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>“If she had gone out, I should have been disappointed,”
	smiled Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You desire to see her, monsieur?”</p>

	<p>“To thank her before I go for her kindness to me.”</p>

	<p>The old face wrinkled into a smile.</p>

	<p>“It was not then for the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux yeux</em> of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand’mère</em>
	that you entered?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194"> </a>”<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si, si!</em> Of course it was,” he protested. “But
	one, nevertheless, must be polite to mademoiselle.”</p>

	<p>“<em>Aïe! aïe!</em>” said the old woman, bustling out:
	“I’ll call her.”</p>

	<p>Presently Jeanne came in alone, calm, cool, and in
	her plain black dress, looking like a sweet Fate. From
	the top of her dark brown hair to her trim, stout shoes,
	she gave the impression of being exquisitely ordered,
	bodily and spiritually.</p>

	<p>“It was good of you to come,” he cried, and they
	shook hands instinctively, scarcely realizing it was
	for the first time. But he was sensitive to the frank
	grip of her long and slender fingers.</p>

	<p>“Toinette said you wished to see me.”</p>

	<p>“We are going to-night. I had to come and bid
	you <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</em>!”</p>

	<p>“Is the company returning?”</p>

	<p>“So I hear the quartermaster says. Are you glad?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, I am glad. One doesn’t like to lose friends.”</p>

	<p>“You regard me as a friend, Jeanne?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour sûr</em>,” she replied simply.</p>

	<p>“Then you don’t mind my calling you Jeanne?”
	said he.</p>

	<p>“What does it matter? There are graver questions
	at stake in the world.”</p>

	<p>She crossed the kitchen and opened the yard door
	which Doggie had closed behind him. Meeting a
	query in his glance, she said:</p>

	<p>“I like the fresh air, and I don’t like secrecy.”</p>

	<p>She leaned against the edge of the table and Doggie,
	emboldened, seated himself on the corner by her
	side, and they looked out into the little flagged courtyard
	in which the men, some in grey shirt-sleeves, some
	in tunics, were lounging about among the little piles of
	accoutrements and packs. Here and there a man was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195"> </a>shaving by the aid of a bit of mirror supported on a
	handcart. Jests and laughter were flung in the quiet
	afternoon air. A little group were feeding pigeons
	which, at the sight of crumbs, had swarmed iridescent
	from the tall <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">colombier</em> in the far corner near the
	gabled barn. As Jeanne did not speak, at last Doggie
	bent forward and, looking into her eyes, found them
	moist with tears.</p>

	<p>“What is the matter, Jeanne?” he asked in a low
	voice.</p>

	<p>“The war, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</em>,” she replied, turning her face
	towards him, “the haunting tragedy of the war.
	I don’t know how to express what I mean. If all
	those brave fellows there went about with serious
	faces, I should not be affected. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, voyez-vous,
	leur gaieté fait peur.</em>”</p>

	<p><em>Their laughter frightened her.</em> Doggie, with his
	quick responsiveness, understood. She had put into
	a phrase the haunting tragedy of the war. The
	eternal laughter of youth quenched in a gurgle of the
	throat.</p>

	<p>He said admiringly: “You are a wonderful woman,
	Jeanne.”</p>

	<p>Her delicate shoulders moved, ever so little. “A
	woman? I suppose I am. The day before we fled
	from Cambrai it was my <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jour de fête</em>. I was eighteen.”</p>

	<p>Doggie drew in his breath with a little gasp. He
	had thought she was older than he.</p>

	<p>“I am twenty-seven,” he said.</p>

	<p>She looked at him calmly and critically. “Yes.
	Now I see. Until now I should have given you more.
	But the war ages people. Isn’t it true?”</p>

	<p>“I suppose so,” said Doggie. Then he had a
	brilliant idea. “But when the war is over, we’ll
	remain the same age for ever and ever.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page196" title="196"> </a>“Do you think so?”</p>

	<p>“I’m sure of it. We’ll still both be in our twenties.
	Let us suppose the war puts ten years of experience and
	suffering, and what not, on to our lives. We’ll only
	then be in our thirties—and nothing possibly can
	happen to make us grow any older. At seventy we
	shall still be thirty.”</p>

	<p>“You are consoling,” she admitted. “But what
	if the war had added thirty years to one’s life? What
	if I felt now an old woman of fifty? But yes, it is
	quite true. I have the feelings and the disregard
	of convention of a woman of fifty. If there had been
	no war, do you think I could have gone among
	an English army—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans gêne</em>—like an old matron?
	Do you think a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune fille française bien élevée</em> could
	have talked to you alone as I have done the past two
	days? Absurd. The explanation is the war.”</p>

	<p>Doggie laughed. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la guerre!</em>” said he.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais non!</em> Be serious. We must come to an
	understanding.”</p>

	<p>In her preoccupation she forgot the rules laid down
	for the guidance of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunes filles bien élevées</em>, and unthinkingly
	perched herself full on the kitchen table on the
	corner of which Doggie sat in a one-legged way.
	Doggie gasped again. All her assumed age fell from
	her like a garment. Youth proclaimed itself in her
	attitude and the supple lines of her figure. She was
	but a girl after all, a girl with a steadfast soul that had
	been tried in unutterable fires; but a girl appealing,
	desirable. He felt mighty protective.</p>

	<p>“An understanding? All right,” said he.</p>

	<p>“I don’t want you to go away and think ill of me—that
	I am one of those women—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les affranchies</em> I think
	they call them—who think themselves above social
	laws. I am not. I am <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoise</em> to my finger-tips,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197"> </a>and I reverence all the old maxims and prejudices in
	which I was born. But conditions are different.
	It is just like the priests who have been called into the
	ranks. To look at them from the outside, you would
	never dream they were priests—but their hearts and
	their souls are untouched.”</p>

	<p>She was so earnest, in her pathetic youthfulness, to
	put herself right with him, so unlike the English girls of
	his acquaintance, who would have taken this chance
	companionship as a matter of course, that his face lost
	the smile and became grave, and he met her sad eyes.</p>

	<p>“That was very bravely said, Jeanne. To me
	you will be always the most wonderful woman I have
	ever known.”</p>

	<p>“What caused you to speak to me the first day?”
	she asked, after a pause.</p>

	<p>“I explained to you—to apologize for staring
	rudely into your house.”</p>

	<p>“It was not because you said to yourself, ‘Here
	is a pretty girl looking at me. I’ll go and talk to
	her’?”</p>

	<p>Doggie threw his leg over the corner of the table
	and stood on indignant feet.</p>

	<p>“Jeanne! How could you——?” he cried.</p>

	<p>She leaned back, her open palms on the table. The
	rare light came into her eyes.</p>

	<p>“That’s what I wanted to know. Now we understand
	each other, Monsieur Trevor.”</p>

	<p>“I wish you wouldn’t call me Monsieur Trevor,”
	said he.</p>

	<p>“What else can I call you? I know no other
	name.”</p>

	<p>Now he had in his pocket a letter from Peggy,
	received that morning, beginning “My dearest
	Marmaduke.” Peggy seemed far away, and the name
	<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198"> </a>still farther. He was deliberating whether he should
	say “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Appelez-moi James</em>” or “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Appelez-moi Jacques</em>,”
	and inclining to the latter as being more picturesque
	and intimate, when she went on:</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tenez</em>, what is it your comrades call you? ‘Doggie’?”</p>

	<p>“Say that again.”</p>

	<p>“Dog-gie.”</p>

	<p>He had never dreamed that the hated appellation
	could sound so adorable. Well—no one except his
	officers called him by any other name, and it came
	with a visible charm from her lips. It brought about
	the most fascinating flash of the tips of her white
	teeth. He laughed.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A la guerre comme à la guerre.</em> If you call me
	that, you belong to the regiment. And I promise you,
	it is a fine regiment.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien</em>, Monsieur Dog-gie——”</p>

	<p>“There’s no monsieur about it,” he declared,
	very happily. “Tommies are not <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">messieurs</em>.”</p>

	<p>“I know one who is,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>So they talked in a young and foolish way, and
	Jeanne for a while forgot the tragedies that had gone
	and the tragedies that might come; and Doggie
	forgot both the peacock and ivory room and the fetid
	hole into which he would have to creep when the night’s
	march was over. They talked of simple things.
	Of Toinette, who had been with Aunt Morin ever
	since she could remember.</p>

	<p>“You have won her heart with your snuff.”</p>

	<p>“She has won mine with her discretion.”</p>

	<p>“Oh-h!” said Jeanne, shocked.</p>

	<p>And so on and so forth, as they sat side by side on
	the kitchen table, swinging their feet. After a while
	they drifted to graver questions.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199"> </a>“What will happen to you, Jeanne, if your aunt
	dies?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em>” said Jeanne——</p>

	<p>“But you will inherit the property, and the business?”</p>

	<p>By no means. Aunt Morin had still a son, who was
	already very old. He must be forty-six. He had
	expatriated himself many years ago and was in Madagascar.
	The son who was killed was her Benjamin,
	the child of her old age. But all her little fortune
	would go to the colonial Gaspard, whom Jeanne had
	never seen.</p>

	<p>But the Farm of La Folette?</p>

	<p>“It has been taken and retaken by Germans and
	French and English, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon pauvre ami</em>, until there is no
	farm left. You ought to understand that.”</p>

	<p>It was a thing that Doggie most perfectly understood:
	a patch of hideous wilderness, of poisoned,
	shell-scarred, ditch-defiled, barren, loathsome earth.</p>

	<p>And her other relations? Only an uncle, her
	father’s youngest brother, a curé in Douai in enemy
	occupation. She had not heard of him since the
	flight from Cambrai.</p>

	<p>“But what is going to become of you?”</p>

	<p>“So long as one keeps a brave heart what, does
	it matter? I am strong. I have a good enough
	education. I can earn my living. Oh, don’t make
	any mistake. I have no pity for myself. Those who
	waste efforts in pitying themselves are not of the stuff
	to make France victorious.”</p>

	<p>“I am afraid I have done a lot of self-pitying, Jeanne.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t do it any more,” she said gently.</p>

	<p>“I won’t,” said he.</p>

	<p>“If you keep to the soul you have gained, you
	can’t,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200"> </a>”<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours la sagesse.</em>”</p>

	<p>“You are laughing at me.”</p>

	<p>“God forbid,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Phineas and Mo came strolling towards the kitchen
	door.</p>

	<p>“My two friends, to pay their visit of adieu,” said
	he.</p>

	<p>Jeanne slid from the table and welcomed the newcomers
	in her calm, dignified way. Once more
	Doggie found himself regarding her as his senior in
	age and wisdom and conduct of life. The pathetic
	girlishness which she had revealed to him had gone.
	The age-investing ghosts had returned.</p>

	<p>Mo grinned, interjected a British Army French
	word now and then, and manifested delight when
	Jeanne understood. Phineas talked laboriously, endeavouring
	to expound his responsibility for Doggie’s
	welfare. He had been his tutor. He used the word
	“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuteur</em>.”</p>

	<p>“That’s a guardian, you silly ass,” cried Doggie.
	“He means ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instituteur</em>.’ Go on. Or, rather, don’t
	go on. The lady isn’t interested.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais si</em>,” said Jeanne, catching at the last English
	word. “It interests me greatly.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, mademoiselle</em>,” said Phineas grandly. “I
	only wish to explain to you that while I live you
	need have no fear for Doggie. I will protect him
	with my body from shells and promise to bring him
	safe back to you. And so will Monsieur Shendish.”</p>

	<p>“What’s that?” asked Mo.</p>

	<p>Phineas translated.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui, oui!</em>” said Mo, nodding vigorously.</p>

	<p>A spot of colour burned on Jeanne’s pale cheek,
	and Doggie grew red under his tanned skin. He
	cursed Phineas below his breath, and exchanged a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201"> </a>significant glance with Mo. Jeanne said, in her even
	voice:</p>

	<p>“I hope all the Three Musketeers will come back
	safe.”</p>

	<p>Mo extended a grimy hand. “Well, good-bye,
	miss! McPhail here and I must be going.”</p>

	<p>She shook hands with both, wishing them <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne
	chance</em>, and they strolled away. Doggie lingered.</p>

	<p>“You mustn’t mind what McPhail says. He’s
	only an old imbecile.”</p>

	<p>“You have two comrades who love you. That
	is the principal thing.”</p>

	<p>“I think they do, each in his way. As for
	Mo——”</p>

	<p>“Mo?” She laughed. “He is delicious.”</p>

	<p>“Well——” said he reluctantly, after a pause,
	“good-bye, Jeanne.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</em>—Dog-gie.”</p>

	<p>“If I shouldn’t come back—I mean if we were
	billeted somewhere else—I should like to write to
	you.”</p>

	<p>“Well—Mademoiselle Bossière, chez Madame
	Morin, Frélus. That is the address.”</p>

	<p>“And will you write too?”</p>

	<p>Without waiting for a reply, he scribbled what was
	necessary on a sheet torn from a notebook and gave
	it to her. Their hands met.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</em>, Jeanne.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</em>, Dog-gie. But I shall see you again
	to-night.”</p>

	<p>“Where?”</p>

	<p>“It is my secret. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne chance.</em>”</p>

	<p>She smiled and turned to leave the kitchen. Doggie
	clattered into the yard.</p>

	<p>“Been doin’ a fine bit o’ coartin’, Doggie,” said
	<a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202"> </a>Private Appleyard from Taunton, who was sitting on a
	box near by and writing a letter on his knees.</p>

	<p>“Not so much of your courting, Spud,” replied
	Doggie cheerfully. “Who are you writing to?
	Your best girl?”</p>

	<p>“I be writin’ to my own lawful mizzus,” replied
	Spud Appleyard.</p>

	<p>“Then give her my love. Doggie Trevor’s love,”
	said Doggie, and marched away through the groups of
	men.</p>

	<p>At the entrance to the barn he fell in with Phineas
	and Mo.</p>

	<p>“Laddie,” said the former, “although I meant
	it at the time as a testimony of my affection, I’ve
	been thinking that what I said to the young leddy
	may not have been over-tactful.”</p>

	<p>“It was taking it too much for granted,” explained
	Mo, “that you and her were sort of keeping company.”</p>

	<p>“You’re a pair of idiots,” said Doggie, sitting
	down between them, and taking out his pink packet
	of Caporal. “Have a cigarette?”</p>

	<p>“Not if I wos dying of——Look ’ere,” said Mo,
	with the light on his face of the earnest seeker after
	Truth. “If a chap ain’t got no food, he’s dying
	of ’unger. If he ain’t got no drink, he’s dying of
	thirst. What the ’ell is he dying of if he ain’t got no
	tobakker?”</p>

	<p>“Army Service Corps,” said Phineas, pulling out
	his pipe.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">It was dark when A Company marched away.
	Doggie had seen nothing more of Jeanne. He was
	just a little disappointed; for she had promised. He
	could not associate her with light words. Yet perhaps
	<a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203"> </a>she had kept her promise. She had said “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous
	verrai.</em>” She had not undertaken to exhibit herself
	to him. He derived comfort from the thought.
	There was, indeed, something delicate and subtle and
	enchanting in the notion. As on the previous day, the
	fine weather had changed with the night and a fine rain
	was falling. Doggie, an indistinguishable pack-laden
	ant in the middle of the four-abreast ribbon of similar
	pack-laden ants, tramped on in silence, thinking his
	own thoughts. A regiment going back to the trenches
	in the night is, from the point of view of the pomp
	and circumstance of glorious war, a very lugubrious
	procession. The sight of it would have hurt an old-time
	poet. An experienced regiment has no lovely
	illusions. It knows what it is going to, and the knowledge
	makes it serious. It would much rather be
	in bed or on snug straw than plodding through the
	rain to four days and nights of eternal mud and stinking
	high-explosive shell. It sets its teeth and is a very
	stern, silent, ugly conglomeration of men.</p>

	<p>“—— (<em>the adjective</em>) night,” growled Doggie’s
	right-hand neighbour.</p>

	<p>“—— (<em>the adjective</em>)” Doggie responded mechanically.</p>

	<p>But to Doggie it was less “——” (<em>adjective as
	before</em>) than usual. Jeanne’s denunciation of self-pity
	had struck deep. Compared with her calamities,
	half of which would have been the stock-in-trade of
	a Greek dramatist wherewith to wring tears from
	mankind for a couple of thousand years, what were his
	own piffling grievances? As for the “——” night,
	instead of a drizzle he would have welcomed a waterspout.
	Something that really mattered…. Let
	the heavens or the Hun rain molten lead. Something
	that would put him on an equality with Jeanne….
	<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204"> </a>Jeanne, with her dark haunting eyes and mobile lips,
	and her slim young figure and her splendid courage.
	A girl apart from the girls he had known, apart from
	the women he had known, the women whom he had
	imagined—and he had not imagined many—his training
	had atrophied such imaginings of youth. Jeanne.
	Again her name conjured up visions of the Great Jeanne
	of Domrémy. If only he could have seen her once
	again!</p>

	<p>At the north end of the village the road took a sharp
	twist, skirting a bit of rising ground. There was just
	a glimmer of a warning light which streamed athwart
	the turning ribbon of laden ants. And as Doggie
	wheeled through the dim ray he heard a voice that rang
	out clear:</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne chance!</em>”</p>

	<p>He looked up swiftly. Caught the shadow of a
	shadow. But it was enough. It was Jeanne. She
	had kept her promise. The men responded incoherently,
	waving their hands, and Doggie’s shout of
	“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</em>” was lost. But though he knew, with a
	wonderful throbbing knowledge, that Jeanne’s cry
	was meant for him alone, he was thrilled by his
	comrades’ instant response to Jeanne’s voice. Not a
	man but he knew that it was Jeanne. But no matter.
	The company paid homage to Jeanne. Jeanne who
	had come out in the rain and the wind and the dark,
	and had waited, waited, to redeem her promise.
	“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est mon secret.</em>”</p>

	<p>He ploughed on. Left, right! Thud, thud!
	Left, right! Jeanne, Jeanne!</p>

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XV</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> the village of Frélus life went on as before.
	The same men, though a different regiment,
	filled its streets and its houses; for by what signs could
	the inhabitants distinguish one horde of English infantrymen
	from another? Once a Highland battalion
	had been billeted on them, and for the first day or so
	they derived some excitement from the novelty of the
	costume; the historic Franco-Scottish tradition still
	lingered, and they welcomed the old allies of France
	with especial kindliness; but they found that the habits
	and customs of the men in kilts were identical, in their
	French eyes, with those of the men in trousers. It
	is true the Scotch had bagpipes. The village turned
	out to listen to them in whole-eyed and whole-eared
	wonder. And the memory of the skirling music
	remained indelible. Otherwise there was little difference.
	And when a Midland regiment succeeded a
	South Coast regiment, where was the difference at all?
	They might be the same men.</p>

	<p>Jeanne, standing by the kitchen door, watching
	the familiar scene in the courtyard, could scarcely
	believe there had been a change. Now and again she
	caught herself wondering why she could not pick
	out any one of her Three Musketeers. There were
	two or three soldiers, as usual, helping Toinette with
	her crocks at the well. There she was, herself,
	moving among them, as courteously treated as though
	she were a princess. Perhaps these men, whom she
	<a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206"> </a>heard had come from manufacturing centres, were a
	trifle rougher in their manners than her late guests;
	but the intention of civility and rude chivalry was no
	less sincere. They came and asked for odds and
	ends very politely. To all intents and purposes they
	were the same set of men. Why was not Doggie
	among them? It seemed very strange.</p>

	<p>After a while she made some sort of an acquaintance
	with a sergeant who had a few words of French
	and appeared anxious to improve his knowledge of
	the language. He explained that he had been a
	teacher in what corresponded to the French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecoles
	Normales</em>. He came from Birmingham, which he
	gave her to understand was a glorified Lille. She
	found him very earnest, very self-centred in his worship
	of efficiency. As he had striven for his class of boys,
	so now was he striving for his platoon of men. In a
	dogmatic way he expounded to her ideals severely
	practical. In their few casual conversations he
	interested her. The English, from the first terrible
	day of their association with her, had commanded
	her deep admiration. But until lately—in the most
	recent past—her sex, her national aloofness and her
	ignorance of English, had restrained her from familiar
	talk with the British Army. But now she keenly desired
	to understand this strange, imperturbable, kindly race.
	She put many questions to the sergeant—always at
	the kitchen door, in full view of the courtyard, for she
	never thought of admitting him into the house—and
	his answers, even when he managed to make himself
	intelligible, puzzled her exceedingly. One of his
	remarks led her to ask for what he was fighting,
	beyond his apparently fixed idea of the efficiency of
	the men under his control. What was the spiritual
	idea at the back of him?</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207"> </a>“The democratization of the world and the universal
	brotherhood of mankind.”</p>

	<p>“When the British Lion shall lie down with the
	German Lamb?”</p>

	<p>He flashed a suspicious glance. Strenuous schoolmasters
	in primary schools have little time for the
	cultivation of a sense of humour.</p>

	<p>“Something of the sort must be the ultimate result
	of the war.”</p>

	<p>“But in the meantime you have got to change the
	German wolf into the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit mouton</em>. How are you
	going to do it?”</p>

	<p>“By British efficiency. By proving to him that
	we are superior to him in every way. We’ll teach
	him that it doesn’t pay to be a wolf.”</p>

	<p>“And do you think he will like being transformed
	into a lamb, while you remain a lion?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t suppose so, but we’ll give him his chance
	to try to become a lion too.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne shook her head. “No, monsieur, wolf he
	is and wolf he will remain. A wolf with venomous
	teeth. The civilized world must see that the teeth
	are always drawn.”</p>

	<p>“I’m speaking of fifty years hence,” said the sergeant.</p>

	<p>“And I of three hundred years hence.”</p>

	<p>“You’re mistaken, mademoiselle.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne shook her head. “No. I’m not mistaken.
	Tell me. Why do you want to become brother to
	the Boche?”</p>

	<p>“I’m not going to be his brother till the war’s
	over,” said the sergeant stolidly. “At present I am
	devoting all my faculties to killing as many of him
	as I can.”</p>

	<p>She smiled. “Sufficient for the day is the good
	thereof. Go on killing them, monsieur. The more
	<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208"> </a>you kill the fewer there will be for your children and
	your grandchildren to lie down with.”</p>

	<p>She left him and tried to puzzle out his philosophy.
	For the ordinary French philosophy of the war is very
	simple. They have no high-falutin, altruistic ideas
	of improving the Boche. They don’t care a tinker’s
	curse what happens to the unholy brood beyond the
	Rhine, so long as they are beaten, humiliated, subjected:
	so long as there is no chance of their ever deflowering
	again with their brutality the sacred soil of France.
	The French mind cannot conceive the idea of this
	beautiful brotherhood; but, on the contrary, rejects
	it as something loathsome, something bordering on
	spiritual defilement….</p>

	<p>No; Jeanne could not accept the theory that we
	were waging war for the ultimate chastening and
	beatification of Germany. She preferred Doggie’s
	reason for fighting. For his soul. There was something
	which she could grip. And having gripped
	it, it was something around which her imagination
	could weave a web of noble fancy. After all, when she
	came to think of it, every one of the Allies must be
	fighting for his soul. For his soul’s sake had not her
	father died? Although she knew no word of German,
	it was obvious that the Uhlan officer had murdered
	him because he had refused to betray his country.
	And her uncle. To fight for his soul, had he not gone
	out with his heroic but futile sporting gun? And this
	pragmatical sergeant? What else had led him from
	his schoolroom to the battlefield? Why couldn’t he be
	honest about it, like Doggie?</p>

	<p>She missed Doggie. He ought to be there, as she
	had often seen him unobserved, talking with his
	friends or going about his military duties, or playing
	the flageolet with the magical touch of the musician.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209"> </a>She knew far more of Doggie than he was aware
	of … And at night she prayed for the little English
	soldier who was facing Death.</p>

	<p>She had much time to think of him during the
	hours when she sat by the bedside of Aunt Morin,
	who talked incessantly of François-Marie who was
	killed on the Argonne, and Gaspard who, as a <em>territorial</em>,
	was no doubt defending Madagascar from invasion.
	And it was pleasant to think of him, because he was a
	new distraction from tragical memories. He seemed
	to lay the ghosts … He was different from all the
	Englishmen she had met. The young officers who
	had helped her in her flight, had very much the same
	charm of breeding, very much the same intonation
	of voice; instinctively she knew him to be of the
	same social caste; but they, and the officers whom
	she saw about the street and in the courtyard, when
	duty called them there, had the military air of command.
	And this her little English soldier had not.
	Of course, he was only a private, and privates are
	trained to obedience. She knew that perfectly well.
	But why was he not commanding instead of obeying?
	There was a reason for it. She had seen it in his eyes.
	She wished she had made him talk more about himself.
	Perhaps she had been unsympathetic and selfish. He
	assumed, she reflected, a certain <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crânerie</em> with his
	fellows—and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crânerie</em> is “swagger” bereft of vulgarity—we
	have no word to connote its conception
	in a French mind—and she admired it; but her swift
	intuition pierced the assumption. She divined a
	world of hesitancies behind the Musketeer swing of
	the shoulders. He was so gentle, so sensitive, so
	quick to understand. And yet so proud. And yet
	again so unconfessedly dependent. Her woman’s
	protective instinct responded to a mute appeal.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210"> </a>“But, Ma’amselle Jeanne, you are wet through,
	you are perished with cold. What folly have you
	been committing?” Toinette scolded, when she
	returned after wishing Doggie the last “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne chance</em>.”</p>

	<p>“The folly of putting my Frenchwoman’s heart
	(<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon cœur de Française</em>) into the hands of a brave little
	soldier to fight with him in the trenches.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu, ma’amselle</em>, you had better go straight
	to bed, and I will bring you a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon tilleul</em>, which will calm
	your nerves and produce a good perspiration.”</p>

	<p>So Toinette put Jeanne to bed and administered
	the infallible infusion of lime leaves, and Jeanne was
	never the worse for her adventure. But the next day
	she wondered a little why she had undertaken it. She
	had a vague idea that it paid a little debt of sympathy.</p>

	<p>An evening or two afterwards Jeanne was sewing in
	the kitchen when Toinette, sitting in the arm-chair
	by the extinct fire, fished out of her pocket the little
	olive-wood box with the pansies and forget-me-nots
	on the lid, and took a long pinch of snuff. She did
	it with somewhat of an air which caused Jeanne to
	smile.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dites donc</em>, Toinette, you are insupportable with
	your snuff-box. One would say a marquise of the
	old school.”</p>

	<p>“Ah, Ma’amselle Jeanne,” said the old woman,
	“you must not laugh at me. I was just thinking
	that, if anything happened to the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit monsieur</em>, I
	couldn’t have the heart to go on putting his snuff
	up my old nose.”</p>

	<p>“Nothing will happen to him,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>The old woman sighed and re-engulfed the snuff-box.
	“Who knows? From one minute to another
	who knows whether the little ones who are dear to
	us are alive or dead?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211"> </a>“And this <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit monsieur</em> is dear to you, Toinette?”
	Jeanne asked, in her even voice, without looking
	up from her sewing.</p>

	<p>“Since he resembles my <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petiot</em>.”</p>

	<p>“He will come back,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“I hope so,” said the old woman mournfully.</p>

	<p>In spite of manifold duties, Jeanne found the days
	curiously long. She slept badly. The tramp of the
	sentry below her window over the archway brought her
	no sense of comfort, as it had done for months before
	the coming of Doggie. All the less did it produce the
	queer little thrill of happiness which was hers when,
	looking down through the shutter slats she had identified
	in the darkness, on a change of guard, the little
	English soldier to whom she had spoken so intimately.
	And when he had challenged the rounds, she had
	recognized his voice…. If she had obeyed an
	imbecile and unmaidenly impulse, she would have
	drawn open the shutter and revealed herself. But
	apart from maidenly shrinkings, familiarity with war
	had made her realize the sacred duties of a sentry,
	and she had remained in discreet seclusion, awake
	until his spell was over. But now the rhythmical
	beat of the heavy boots kept her from sleeping and
	would have irritated her nerves intolerably had not
	her sound common sense told her that the stout fellow
	who wore them was protecting her from the Hun,
	together with a million or so of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

	<p>She found herself counting the days to Doggie’s
	return.</p>

	<p>“At last, it is to-morrow!” she said to Toinette.</p>

	<p>“What is it to-morrow?” asked the old woman.</p>

	<p>“The return of our regiment,” replied Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“That is good. We have a regiment now,” said
	Toinette ironically.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212"> </a>The Midland company marched away—as so many
	had marched away before; but Jeanne did not go
	to the little embankment at the turn of the road to
	wish anyone good luck. She stood at the house
	door, as she had always done, to watch them pass
	in the darkness; for there is always something in the
	sight of men going into battle which gives you a lump
	in the throat. For Jeanne it had almost grown into
	a religious practice.</p>

	<p>The sergeant had told her that the new-comers
	would arrive at dawn. She slept a little; awoke with
	a start as day began to break; dressed swiftly, and
	went downstairs to wait. And then her ear caught the
	rumble and the tramp of the approaching battalion.
	Presently transport rolled by, and squads of men,
	haggard in the grey light, bending double under their
	packs, staggered along to their billets. And then
	came a rusty crew, among whom she recognized
	McPhail’s tall gaunt figure. She stood by the gateway,
	bareheaded, in her black dress and blue apron,
	defying the sharp morning air, and watched them pass
	through. She saw Mo Shendish, his eyes on the heels
	of the man in front. She recognized nearly all.
	But the man she looked for was not there.</p>

	<p>He could not have passed without her seeing him;
	but as soon as the gateway was clear, she ran into the
	courtyard and fled across it to cut off the men. There
	was no Doggie. Blank disappointment was succeeded
	by sudden terror.</p>

	<p>Phineas saw her coming. He stumbled up to her,
	dropped his pack at her feet, and spread out both his
	hands. She lost sight of the horde of weary clay-covered
	men around her. She cried:</p>

	<p>“Where is he?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213"> </a>“He is dead?”</p>

	<p>“No one knows.”</p>

	<p>“But you must know, you!” cried Jeanne, with a
	new fear in her eyes which Phineas could not bear
	to meet. “You promised to bring him back.”</p>

	<p>“It was not my fault,” said Phineas. “He was
	out last night—no, the night before, this is morning—repairing
	barbed wire. I was not with him.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, mon Dieu</em>, why not?”</p>

	<p>“Because the duties of soldiers are arranged for
	them by their officers, mademoiselle.”</p>

	<p>“It is true. Pardon. But continue.”</p>

	<p>“A party went out to repair wire. It was quite
	dark. Suddenly a German rifle-shot gave the alarm.
	The enemy threw up star-shells and the front trenches
	on each side opened fire. The wiring party, of course,
	lay flat on the ground. One of them was wounded.
	When it was all over—it didn’t last long—our men
	got back, bringing the wounded man.”</p>

	<p>“He is severely wounded? Speak,” cried Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“The wounded man was not Doggie. Doggie
	went out with the party, but he did not come back.
	That’s why I said no one knows where he is.”</p>

	<p>She stiffened. “He is lying out there. He is dead.”</p>

	<p>“Shendish and I and Corporal Wilson over there,
	who was with the party, got permission to go out and
	search. We searched all round where the repair
	had been going on. But we could not find him.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</em> I ought not to have reproached you,”
	she said steadily. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un grand malheur.</em>”</p>

	<p>“You are right. Life for me is no longer of much
	value.”</p>

	<p>She looked at him in her penetrating way.</p>

	<p>“I believe you,” she said. “For the moment,
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</em>. You must be worn out with fatigue.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214"> </a>She left him and walked through the straggling men,
	who made respectful way for her. All knew of her
	friendship with Doggie Trevor and all realized the
	nature of this interview. They liked Doggie because
	he was good-natured and plucky, and never complained
	and would play the whistle on march as long as breath
	enough remained in his body. As his uncle, the
	Dean, had said, breed told. In a curious, half-grudging
	way they recognized the fact. They laughed at his
	singular inefficiency in the multitudinous arts of the
	handy-man, proficiency in which is expected from the
	modern private, but they knew that he would go on
	till he dropped. And knowing that, they saved him
	from many a reprimand which his absurd efforts in
	the arts aforesaid would have brought upon him.
	And now that Doggie was gone, they deplored his
	loss. But so many had gone. So many had been
	deplored. Human nature is only capable of a certain
	amount of deploring while retaining its sanity. The
	men let the pale French girl, who was Doggie Trevor’s
	friend, pass by in respectful silence—and that, for
	them, was their final tribute to Doggie Trevor.</p>

	<p>Jeanne passed into the kitchen. Toinette drew a
	sharp breath at the sight of her face.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quoi? Il n’est pas là?</em>”</p>

	<p>“No,” said Jeanne. “He is wounded.” It was
	impossible to explain to Toinette.</p>

	<p>“Badly?”</p>

	<p>“They don’t know.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh, là, là!</em>” sighed Toinette. “That always
	happens. That is what I told you.”</p>

	<p>“We have no time to think of such things,” said
	Jeanne.</p>

	<p>The regimental cooks came up for the hot water,
	and soon the hungry, weary, nerve-racked men were
	<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215"> </a>served with the morning meal. And Jeanne stood in the
	courtyard in front of the kitchen door and helped with
	the filling of the tea-kettles, as though no little English
	soldier called “Dog-gie” had ever existed in the
	regiment.</p>

	<p>The first pale shaft of sunlight fell upon the kitchen
	side of the courtyard, and in it Jeanne stood illuminated.
	It touched the shades of gold in her dark brown hair,
	and lit up her pale face and great unsmiling eyes.
	But her lips smiled valiantly.</p>

	<p>“What do yer think, Mac,” said Mo Shendish,
	squatting on the flagstones, “do you think she was
	really sweet on him?”</p>

	<p>“Man,” replied Phineas, similarly engaged, “all I
	know is that she has added him to her collection of
	ghosts. It’s not an over-braw company for a lassie
	to live with.”</p>

	<p>And then, soon afterwards, the trench-broken men
	stumbled into the barn to sleep, and all was quiet
	again, and Jeanne went about her daily tasks with
	the familiar hand of death once more closing icily
	around her heart.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XVI"><a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> sick-room was very hot, and Aunt Morin
	very querulous. Jeanne opened a window,
	but Aunt Morin complained of currents of air. Did
	Jeanne want to kill her? So Jeanne closed the window.
	The internal malady from which Aunt Morin suffered,
	and from which it was unlikely that she would recover,
	caused her considerable pain from time to
	time; and on these occasions she grew fractious and
	hard to bear with. The retired septuagenarian village
	doctor who had taken the modest practice of his son,
	now far away with the Army, advised an operation.
	But Aunt Morin, with her peasant’s prejudice, declined
	flatly. She knew what happened in those hospitals
	where they cut people up just for the pleasure of
	looking at their insides. She was not going to let a
	lot of butchers amuse themselves with her old carcass.
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh non!</em> When it pleased the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</em> to take her,
	she was ready: the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</em> required no assistance
	from <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ces messieurs</em>. And even if she had consented,
	how to take her to Paris, and once there, how to get
	the operation performed, with all the hospitals full and
	all the surgeons at the Front? The old doctor shrugged
	his shoulders and kept life in her as best he might.</p>

	<p>To-day, in the close room, she told a long story of
	the doctor’s neglect. The medicine he gave her was
	water and nothing else—water with nothing in it.
	And to ask people to pay for that! She would not
	pay. What would Jeanne advise?</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page217" title="217"> </a>”<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, ma tante</em>,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, ma tante?</em> But you are not listening to
	what I say. At the least one can be polite.”</p>

	<p>“I am listening, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma tante</em>.”</p>

	<p>“You should be grateful to those who lodge and
	nourish you.”</p>

	<p>“I am grateful, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma tante</em>,” said Jeanne patiently.</p>

	<p>Aunt Morin complained of being robbed on all
	sides. The doctor, Toinette, Jeanne, the English
	soldiers—the last the worst of all. Besides not paying
	sufficiently for what they had, they were so wasteful
	in the things they took for nothing. If they begged
	for a few faggots to make a fire, they walked away
	with the whole woodstack. She knew them. But
	all soldiers were the same. They thought that in
	time of war civilians had no rights. One of these
	days she would get up and come downstairs and see
	for herself the robbery that was going on.</p>

	<p>The windows were tightly sealed. The sunlight
	hurting Aunt Morin’s eyes, the outside shutters were
	half closed. The room felt like a stuffy, overheated,
	overcrowded sepulchre. An enormous oak press, part
	of her Breton dowry, took up most of the side of one
	wall. This, and a great handsome chest, a couple
	of tables, a stiff arm-chair, were all too big for the
	moderately sized apartment. Coloured prints of sacred
	subjects, tilted at violent angles, seemed eager to occupy
	as much air-space as possible. And in the middle of
	the floor sprawled the vast oaken bed, with its heavy
	green brocade curtains falling tentwise from a great
	tarnished gilt crown in the ceiling.</p>

	<p>Jeanne said nothing. What was the good? She
	shifted the invalid’s hot pillow and gave her a drink
	of tisane, moving about the over-furnished, airless
	room in her calm and efficient way. Her face showed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218"> </a>no sign of trouble, but an iron band clamped her
	forehead above her burning eyes. She could perform
	her nurse’s duties, but it was beyond her power to
	concentrate her mind on the sick woman’s unending
	litany of grievances. Far away beyond that darkened
	room, beyond that fretful voice, she saw vividly a
	hot waste, hideous with holes and rusted wire and
	shapes of horror; and in the middle of it lay huddled
	up a little khaki-clad figure with the sun blazing fiercely
	in his unblinking eyes. And his very body was
	beyond the reach of man, even of the most lion-hearted.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais qu’as-tu, ma fille?</em>” asked Aunt Morin.
	“You do not speak. When people are ill they need
	to be amused.”</p>

	<p>“I am sorry, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma tante</em>, but I am not feeling very
	well to-day. It will pass.”</p>

	<p>“I hope so. Young people have no business not
	to feel well. Otherwise what is the good of youth?”</p>

	<p>“It is true,” Jeanne assented.</p>

	<p>But what, she thought, was indeed the good of
	youth, in these terrible days of war? Her own was
	but a panorama of death…. And now one more
	figure, this time one of youth too, had joined it.</p>

	<p>Toinette came in.</p>

	<p>“Ma’amselle Jeanne, there are two English officers
	downstairs who wish to speak to you.”</p>

	<p>“What do they want?” Jeanne asked wearily.</p>

	<p>“They do not say. They just ask for Ma’amselle
	Bossière.”</p>

	<p>“They never leave one in peace, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ces gens-là</em>,”
	grumbled Aunt Morin. “If they want more concessions
	in price, do not let them frighten you. Go
	to Monsieur le Maire to have it arranged with justice.
	These people would eat the skin off your back. Remember,
	Jeanne.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page219" title="219"> </a>”<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien, ma tante</em>,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>She went downstairs, conscious of gripping herself
	in order to discuss with the officers whatever business
	of billeting was in hand. For she had dealt with all
	such matters since her arrival in Frélus. She reached
	the front door and saw a dusty car with a military
	chauffeur at the wheel and two officers, standing on
	the pavement at the foot of the steps. One she recognized
	as the commander of the company to which
	her billeted men belonged. The other was a stranger,
	a lieutenant, with a different badge on his cap. They
	were talking and laughing together, like old friends
	newly met, which by one of the myriad coincidences
	of the war was really the case. On the appearance
	of Jeanne they drew themselves up and saluted politely.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle Bossière?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, monsieur.</em>” Then, “Will you enter, messieurs?”</p>

	<p>They entered the vestibule where the great cask
	gleamed in its polished mahogany and brass. She
	bade them be seated.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle, Captain Willoughby tells me that
	you had billeted here last week a soldier by the name
	of Trevor,” said the stranger, in excellent French,
	taking out notebook and pencil.</p>

	<p>Jeanne’s lips grew white. She had not suspected
	their errand.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, monsieur.</em>”</p>

	<p>“Did you have much talk with him?”</p>

	<p>“Much, monsieur.”</p>

	<p>“Pardon my indiscretion, mademoiselle—it is
	military service, and I am an Intelligence officer—but
	did you tell him about your private affairs?”</p>

	<p>“Very intimately,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>The Intelligence officer made a note or two and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220"> </a>smiled pleasantly—but Jeanne could have struck him
	for daring to smile. “You had every reason for
	thinking him a man of honour?”</p>

	<p>“What’s the good of asking her that, Smithers?”
	Captain Willoughby interrupted in English.
	“Haven’t I given you my word? The man’s a
	mysterious little devil, but any fool can see that he’s
	a gentleman.”</p>

	<p>“What do you say?” Jeanne asked tensely.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je parle français très peu</em>,” replied Captain
	Willoughby with an air of regret.</p>

	<p>Smithers explained. “Monsieur le Capitaine says
	that he guarantees the honesty of the soldier, Trevor.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne flashed, rigid. “Who could doubt it,
	monsieur? He was a gentleman, a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fils de famille</em>,
	of the English aristocracy.”</p>

	<p>“Excuse me for a moment,” said Smithers.</p>

	<p>He went out. Jeanne, uncomprehending, sat silent.
	Captain Willoughby, cursing an idiot education, composed
	in his head a polite French sentence concerning
	the weather, but before he had finished Smithers
	reappeared with a strange twisted packet in his hand.
	He held it out to Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle, do you recognize this?”</p>

	<p>She looked at it dully for a moment; then suddenly
	sprang to her feet and clenched her hands and stared
	open-mouthed. She nodded. She could not speak.
	Her brain swam. They had come to her about
	Doggie, who was dead, and they showed her Père
	Grigou’s packet. What was the connection between
	the two?</p>

	<p>Willoughby rose impulsively. “For God’s sake,
	Smithers, let her down easy. She’ll be fainting all
	over the place in a minute.”</p>

	<p>“If this is your property, mademoiselle,” said
	<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221"> </a>Smithers, laying the packet on the chenille-covered
	table, “you have to thank your friend Trevor for
	restoring it to you.”</p>

	<p>She put up both hands to her reeling head.</p>

	<p>“But he is dead, monsieur!”</p>

	<p>“Not a bit of it. He’s just as much alive as you
	or I.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne swayed, tried to laugh, threw herself half
	on a chair, half over the great cask, and broke down
	in a passion of tears.</p>

	<p>The two men looked at each other uncomfortably.</p>

	<p>“For exquisite tact,” said Willoughby, “commend
	me to an Intelligence officer.”</p>

	<p>“But how the deuce was I to know?” Smithers
	muttered with an injured air. “My instructions were
	to find out the truth of a cock-and-bull story—for
	that’s what it seemed to come to. And a girl in
	billets—well—how was I to know what she was
	like?”</p>

	<p>“Anyhow, here we’ve got hysterics,” said Willoughby.</p>

	<p>“But who told her the fellow was dead?”</p>

	<p>“Why, his pals. I thought so myself. When a
	man’s missing where’s one to suppose him to be—having
	supper at the Savoy?”</p>

	<p>“Well, I give women up,” said Smithers. “I
	thought she’d be glad.”</p>

	<p>“I believe you’re a married man?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

	<p>“Well, I ain’t,” said Willoughby, and in a couple
	of strides he stood close to Jeanne. He laid a gentle
	hand on her heaving shoulders.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas tué! Soolmong blessé</em>,” he shouted.</p>

	<p>She sprang, as it were, to attention, like a frightened
	recruit.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222"> </a>“He is wounded?”</p>

	<p>“Not very seriously, mademoiselle.” Smithers,
	casting an indignant glance at his superior officer’s
	complacent smile, reassumed mastery of the situation.
	“A Boche sniper got him in the leg. It will put
	him out of service for a month or two. But there
	is no danger.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grâce à  Dieu!</em>” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>She leaned for a while against the cask, her hands
	behind her, looking away from the two men. And
	the two young men stood, somewhat embarrassed,
	looking away from her and from each other. At last
	she said, with an obvious striving for the even note
	in her voice:</p>

	<p>“I ask your pardon, messieurs, but sometimes sudden
	happiness is more overwhelming than misfortune. I
	am now quite at your service.”</p>

	<p>“My God! she’s a wonder,” murmured Willoughby,
	who was fair, unmarried, and impressionable.
	“Go on with your dirty work.”</p>

	<p>Smithers, conscious of linguistic superiority—in civil
	life he had been concerned with the wine trade in
	Bordeaux—proceeded to carry out his instructions.
	He turned over a leaf in his notebook and poised a
	ready pencil.</p>

	<p>“I must ask you, mademoiselle, some formal
	questions.”</p>

	<p>“Perfectly, monsieur,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“Where was this packet when last you saw it?”</p>

	<p>She made her statement, calmly.</p>

	<p>“Can you tell me its contents?”</p>

	<p>“Not all, monsieur. I, as a young girl, was not
	in the full confidence of my parents. But I remember
	my uncle saying there were about twenty thousand
	francs in notes, some gold—I know not how much—some
	<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223"> </a>jewellery of my mother’s—oh, a big handful!—rings—one
	a hoop of emeralds and diamonds—a
	brooch with a black pearl belonging to my great-grandmother——”</p>

	<p>“It is enough, mademoiselle,” said Smithers, jotting
	down notes. “Anything else besides money and
	jewellery?”</p>

	<p>“There were papers of my father, share certificates,
	bonds—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que sais-je, moi</em>?”</p>

	<p>Smithers opened the packet, which had already
	been examined.</p>

	<p>“You’re a witness, sir, to the identification of the
	property.”</p>

	<p>“No,” said Willoughby, “I’m just a baby captain
	of infantry, and wonder why the brainy Intelligence
	department doesn’t hand the girl her belongings and
	decently clear out.”</p>

	<p>“I’ve got to make my report, sir,” said Smithers
	stiffly.</p>

	<p>So the schedule was produced and the notes were
	solemnly counted, twenty-one thousand five hundred
	francs, and the gold four hundred francs, and the
	jewels were identified, and the bonds, of which Jeanne
	knew nothing, were checked by a list in her father’s
	handwriting, and Jeanne signed a paper with Smithers’s
	fountain-pen, and Willoughby witnessed her signature,
	and thus she entered into possession of her heritage.</p>

	<p>The officers were about to depart, but Jeanne
	detained them.</p>

	<p>“Messieurs, you must pardon me, but I am quite
	bewildered. As far as I can understand, Monsieur
	Trevor rescued the packet from the well at my uncle’s
	farm of La Folette, and got wounded in doing so.”</p>

	<p>“That is quite so,” said Smithers.</p>

	<p>“But, monsieur, they tell me he was with a party in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224"> </a>front of his trench mending wire. How did he reach
	the well of La Folette? I don’t comprehend at all.”</p>

	<p>Smithers turned to Willoughby.</p>

	<p>“Yes. How the dickens did he know the exact
	spot to go for?”</p>

	<p>“We had taken over a new sector, and I was
	getting the topography right with a map. Trevor
	was near by doing nothing, and as he’s a man of
	education, I asked him to help me. There was the
	site of the farm marked by name, and the ruined
	well away over to the left in No Man’s Land. I
	remember the beggar calling out ‘La Folette!’ in a
	startled voice, and when I asked him what was the
	matter, he said ‘Nothing, sir!’”</p>

	<p>Smithers translated, and continued: “You see,
	mademoiselle, this is what happened, as far as I am
	concerned. I belong to the Lancashire Fusiliers.
	Our battalion is in the trenches farther up the line
	than our friends. Well, just before dawn yesterday
	morning a man rolled over the parapet into our trench,
	and promptly fainted. He had been wounded in the
	leg, and was half dead from loss of blood. Under
	his tunic was this package. We identified him and
	his regiment, and fixed him up and took him to the
	dressing-station. But things looked very suspicious.
	Here was a man who didn’t belong to us with a little
	fortune in loot on his person. As soon as he was fit
	to be interrogated, the C.O. took him in hand. He
	told the C.O. about you and your story. He regarded
	the nearness of the well as something to do with
	Destiny, and resolved to get you back your property—if
	it was still there. The opportunity occurred
	when the wiring party was alarmed. He crept out
	to the ruins by the well, fished out the packet, and a
	sniper got him. He managed to get back to our
	<a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225"> </a>lines, having lost his way a bit, and tumbled into our
	trench.”</p>

	<p>“But he was in danger of death all the time,”
	said Jeanne, losing the steadiness of her voice.</p>

	<p>“He was. Every second. It was one of the most
	dare-devil, scatter-brained things I’ve ever heard of.
	And I’ve heard of many, mademoiselle. The only
	pity is that instead of being rewarded, he will be
	punished.”</p>

	<p>“Punished?” cried Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“Not very severely,” laughed Smithers. “Captain
	Willoughby will see to that. But reflect, mademoiselle.
	His military duty was to remain with his
	comrades, not to go and risk his life to get your property.
	Anyhow, it is clear that he was not out for loot….
	Of course, they sent me here as Intelligence officer,
	to get corroboration of his story.” He paused for a
	moment. Then he added: “Mademoiselle, I must
	congratulate you on the restoration of your fortune
	and the possession of a very brave friend.”</p>

	<p>For the first time the red spots burned on Jeanne’s
	pale face.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous remercie infiniment, monsieur.</em>”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il sera</em> all right,” said Willoughby.</p>

	<p>The officers saluted and went their ways. Jeanne
	took up her packet and mounted to her little room
	in a dream. Then she sat down on her bed, the
	unopened packet by her side, and strove to realize it
	all. But the only articulate thought came to her in
	the words which she repeated over and over again:</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a fait cela pour moi! Il a fait cela pour moi!</em>”</p>

	<p>He had done that for her. It was incredible,
	fantastic, thrillingly true, like the fairy-tales of her
	childhood. The little sensitive English soldier, whom
	his comrades protected, whom she herself in a feminine
	<a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226"> </a>way longed to protect, had done this for her. In a
	shy, almost reverent way, she opened out the waterproof
	covering, as though to reassure herself of the
	reality of things. For the first time since she left
	Cambrai a smile came into her eyes, together with
	grateful tears.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a fait cela pour moi! Il a fait cela pour moi!</em>”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">A while later she relieved Toinette’s guard in the
	sick-room.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien?</em> And the two officers?” queried Aunt
	Morin, after Toinette had gone. “They have stayed
	a long time. What did they want?”</p>

	<p>Jeanne was young. She had eaten the bread of
	dependence, which Aunt Morin, by reason of racial
	instinct and the stress of sorrow and infirmity, had
	contrived to render very bitter. She could not repress
	an exultant note in her voice. Doggie, too, accounted
	for something; for much.</p>

	<p>“They came to bring good news, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma tante</em>. The
	English have found all the money and the jewels and
	the share certificates that Père Grigou hid in the
	well of La Folette.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em> It is true?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, ma tante.</em>”</p>

	<p>“And they have restored them to you?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“It is extraordinary. It is truly extraordinary.
	At last these English seem to be good for something.
	And they found that and gave it to you without
	taking anything?”</p>

	<p>“Without taking anything,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>Aunt Morin reflected for a few moments, then
	she stretched out a thin hand.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma petite Jeanne chérie</em>, you are rich now.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227"> </a>“I don’t know exactly,” replied Jeanne, with a
	mingling of truth and caution. “I have enough for
	the present.”</p>

	<p>“How did it all happen?”</p>

	<p>“It was part of a military operation,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>Perhaps later she might tell Aunt Morin about
	Doggie. But now the thing was too sacred. Aunt
	Morin would question, question maddeningly, until
	the rainbow of her fairy-tale was unwoven. The
	salient fact of the recovery of her fortune should be
	enough for Aunt Morin. It was. The old woman
	of the pain-pinched features looked at her wistfully
	from sunken grey eyes.</p>

	<p>“And now that you are rich, my little Jeanne,
	you will not leave your poor old aunt, who loves you
	so much, to die alone?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, mais non! mais non! mais non!</em>” cried
	Jeanne indignantly. “What do you think I am made
	of?”</p>

	<p>“Ah!” breathed Aunt Morin, comforted.</p>

	<p>“Also,” said Jeanne, in the matter-of-fact French
	way, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si tu veux</em>, I will henceforward pay for my
	lodging and nourishment.”</p>

	<p>“You are very good, my little Jeanne,” said Aunt
	Morin. “That will be a great help, for, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vois-tu</em>,
	we are very poor.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, ma tante.</em> It is the war.”</p>

	<p>“Ah, the war, the war; this awful war! One
	has nothing left.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne smiled. Aunt Morin had a very comfortably
	invested fortune left, for the late Monsieur Morin,
	corn, hay and seed merchant, had been a very astute
	person. It would make little difference to the comfort
	of Aunt Morin, or to the prospects of Cousin Gaspard
	in Madagascar, whether the present business of Veuve
	<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228"> </a>Morin et Fils went on or not. Of this Aunt Morin,
	in lighter moods, had boasted many times.</p>

	<p>“Every one must do what they can,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“Perfectly,” said Aunt Morin. “You are a young
	girl who well understands things. And now—it is
	not good for young people to stay in a sick-room—one
	needs the fresh air. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Va te distraire, ma petite.</em>
	I am quite comfortable.”</p>

	<p>So Jeanne went out to distract a self already distraught
	with great wonder, great pride and great fear.</p>

	<p>He had done that for her. The wonder of it
	bewildered her, the pride of it thrilled her. But he
	was wounded. Fear smothered her joy. They had
	said there was no danger. But soldiers always made
	light of wounds. It was their way in this horrible
	war, in the intimate midst of which she had her being.
	If a man was not dead, he was alive, and thereby
	accounted lucky. In their gay optimism they had
	given him a month or two of absence from the regiment.
	But even in a month or two—where would
	the regiment be? Far, far away from Frélus.
	Would she ever see Doggie again?</p>

	<p>To distract herself she went down the village street,
	bareheaded, and up the lane that led to the little
	church. The church was empty, cool, and smelt of
	the hill-side. Before the tinsel-crowned, mild-faced
	image of the Virgin were spread the poor votive
	offerings of the village. And Jeanne sank on her
	knees, and bowed her head, and, without special
	prayer or formula of devotion, gave herself into the
	hands of the Mother of Sorrows.</p>

	<p>She walked back comforted, vaguely conscious of
	a strengthening of soul. In the vast cataclysm of
	things her own hopes and fears and destiny mattered
	very little. If she never saw Doggie again, if Doggie
	<a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229"> </a>recovered and returned to the war and was killed,
	her own grief mattered very little. She was but a
	stray straw, and mattered very little. But what
	mattered infinitely, what shone with an immortal
	flame, though it were never so tiny, was the Wonderful
	Spiritual Something that had guided Doggie through
	the jaws of death.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">That evening she had a long talk in the kitchen
	with Phineas. The news of Doggie’s safety had
	been given out by Willoughby, without any details.
	Mo Shendish had leaped about her like a fox-terrier,
	and she had laughed, with difficulty restraining her
	tears. But to Phineas alone she told her whole story.
	He listened in bewilderment. And the greater the
	bewilderment, the worse his crude translations of English
	into French. She wound up a long, eager speech
	by saying:</p>

	<p>“He has done this for me. Why?”</p>

	<p>“Love,” replied Phineas bluntly.</p>

	<p>“It is more than love,” said Jeanne, thinking of
	the Wonderful Spiritual Something.</p>

	<p>“If you could understand English,” said Phineas,
	“I would enter into the metaphysics of the subject
	with pleasure, but in French it is beyond me.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne smiled, and turned to the matter-of-fact.</p>

	<p>“He will go to England now that he is wounded?”</p>

	<p>“He’s on the way now,” said Phineas.</p>

	<p>“Has he many friends there? I ask, because he
	talks so little of himself. He is so modest.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, many friends. You see, mademoiselle,” said
	Phineas, with a view to setting her mind at rest,
	“Doggie’s an important person in his part of the
	country. He was brought up in luxury. I know,
	because I lived with him as his tutor for seven years.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230"> </a>His father and mother are dead, and he could go on
	living in luxury now, if he liked.”</p>

	<p>“He is then, rich—Doggie?”</p>

	<p>“He has a fine house of his own in the country,
	with many servants and automobiles, and—wait”—he
	made a swift arithmetical calculation—“and an
	income of eighty thousand francs a year.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment?</em>” cried Jeanne sharply, with a little
	frown.</p>

	<p>Phineas McPhail was enjoying himself, basking in
	the sunshine of Doggie’s wealth. Also, when conversation
	in French resolved itself into the statement of
	simple facts, he could get along famously. So the
	temptation of the glib phrase outran his discretion.</p>

	<p>“Doggie has a fortune of about two million francs.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il doit faire un beau mariage</em>,” said Jeanne, with
	stony calm.</p>

	<p>Phineas suddenly became aware of pitfalls and
	summoned his craft and astuteness and knowledge
	of affairs. He smiled, as he thought, encouragingly.</p>

	<p>“The only fine marriage is with the person one
	loves.”</p>

	<p>“Not always, monsieur,” said Jeanne, who had
	watched the gathering of the sagacities with her deep
	eyes. “In any case”—she rose and held out her hand—“our
	friend will be well looked after in England.”</p>

	<p>“Like a prince,” said Phineas.</p>

	<p>He strode away greatly pleased with himself, and
	went and found Mo Shendish.</p>

	<p>“Man,” said he, “have you ever reflected that the
	dispensing of happiness is the cheapest form of human
	diversion?”</p>

	<p>“What’ve you been doin’ now?” asked Mo.</p>

	<p>“I’ve just left a lassie tottering over with blissful
	dreams.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page231" title="231"> </a>“Gorblime!” said Mo, “and to think that if I
	could sling the lingo, I might’ve done the same!”</p>

	<p>But Phineas had knocked all the dreams out of
	Jeanne. The British happy-go-lucky ways of marriage
	are not those of the French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</em>, and Jeanne
	had no notion of British happy-go-lucky ways.
	Phineas had knocked the dream out of Jeanne by
	kicking Doggie out of her sphere. And there was
	a girl in England in Doggie’s sphere whom he was
	to marry. She knew it. A man does not gather
	his sagacities in order to answer crookedly a direct
	challenge, unless there is some necessity.</p>

	<p>Well. She would never see Doggie again. He
	would pass out of her life. His destiny called him, if
	he survived the slaughter of the war, to the shadowy
	girl in England. Yet he had done <em>that</em> for her.
	For no other woman could he ever in this life do
	<em>that</em> again. It was past love. Her brain boggled
	at an elusive spiritual idea. She was very young,
	flung cleanly trained from the convent into the war’s
	terrific tragedy, wherein maiden romantic fancies
	were scorched in the tender bud. Only her honest
	traditions of marriage remained. Of love she knew
	nothing. She leaped beyond it, seeking, seeking.
	She would never see him again. There she met the
	Absolute. But he had done <em>that</em> for her—that which,
	she knew not why, but she knew—he would do for
	no other woman. The Splendour of it would be her
	everlasting possession.</p>

	<p>She undressed that night, proud, dry-eyed, heroical,
	and went to bed, and listened to the rhythmic tramp
	of the sentry across the gateway below her window,
	and suddenly a lump rose in her throat and she fell
	to crying miserably.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XVII"><a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">“How</span> are you feeling, Trevor?”</p>

	<p>“Nicely, thank you, Sister.”</p>

	<p>“Glad to be in Blighty again?”</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled.</p>

	<p>“Good old Blighty!”</p>

	<p>“Leg hurting you?”</p>

	<p>“A bit, Sister,” he replied with a little grimace.</p>

	<p>“It’s bound to be stiff after the long journey, but
	we’ll soon fix it up for you.”</p>

	<p>“I’m sure you will,” he said politely.</p>

	<p>The nurse moved on. Doggie drew the cool clean
	sheet around his shoulders and gave himself up to
	the luxury of bed—real bed. The morning sunlight
	poured through the open windows, attended by a
	delicious odour which after a while he recognized as
	the scent of the sea. Where he was he had no notion.
	He had absorbed so much of Tommy’s philosophy
	as not to care. He had arrived with a convoy the
	night before, after much travel in ambulances by land
	and sea. If he had been a walking case, he might
	have taken more interest in things; but the sniper’s
	bullet in his thigh had touched the bone, and in spite
	of being carried most tenderly about like a baby, he
	had suffered great pain and longed for nothing and
	thought of nothing but a permanent resting-place.
	Now, apparently, he had found one, and looking about
	him he felt peculiarly content. He seemed to have
	seen no cleaner, whiter, brighter place in the world
	<a class="pagenum" id="page233" title="233"> </a>than this airy ward, swept by the sea-breeze. He
	counted seven beds besides his own. On a table
	running down the ward stood a vase of sweet-peas
	and a bowl of roses. He thought there was never
	in the world so clean and cool a figure as the grey-clad
	nurse in her spotless white apron, cuffs and cap.</p>

	<p>When she passed near him again, he summoned
	her. She came to his bedside.</p>

	<p>“What do you call this particular region of fairyland?”</p>

	<p>She stared at him for a moment, adjusting things
	in her mind; for his name and style were 35792
	Private Trevor, J. M., but his voice and phrase were
	those of her own social class. Then she smiled, and
	told him. The corner of fairyland was a private
	auxiliary hospital in a Lancashire seaside town.</p>

	<p>“Lancashire,” said Doggie, knitting his brow in a
	puzzled way, “but why have they sent me to Lancashire?
	I belong to a West Country regiment, and
	all my friends are in the South.”</p>

	<p>“What’s he grousing about, Sister?” suddenly asked
	the occupant of the next bed. “He’s the sort of
	chap that doesn’t know when he’s in luck and when
	he isn’t. I’m in the Duke of Cornwall’s Light
	Infantry, I am, and when I was hit before, they sent
	me to a military hospital in Inverness. That’d teach
	you, my lad. This for me every time. You ought
	to have something to grouse at.”</p>

	<p>“I’m not grousing, you idiot!” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“’Ere—who’s he calling an idjit?” cried the Duke
	of Cornwall’s Light Infantryman, raising himself on
	his elbow.</p>

	<p>The nurse intervened; explained that no one
	could be said to grumble at a hospital when he called
	it fairyland. Trevor’s question was that of one in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234"> </a>search of information. He did not realize that in
	assigning men to the various hospitals in the United
	Kingdom, the authorities could not possibly take into
	account an individual man’s local association.</p>

	<p>“Oh well, if it’s only his blooming ignorance——”</p>

	<p>“That’s just it, mate,” smiled Doggie, “my
	blooming ignorance.”</p>

	<p>“That’s all right,” said the nurse. “Now you’re
	friends.”</p>

	<p>“He had no right to call me an idjit,” said the
	Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantryman. He was an
	aggressive, red-visaged man with bristly black hair
	and stubbly black moustache.</p>

	<p>“If you’ll agree that he wasn’t grousing, Penworthy,
	I’m sure Trevor will apologize for calling
	you an idiot.”</p>

	<p>And into the nurse’s eyes crept the queer smile of
	the woman learned in the ways of children.</p>

	<p>“Didn’t I say he wasn’t grousing? It was only
	his ignorance?”</p>

	<p>Doggie responded. “I meant no offence, mate,
	in what I said.”</p>

	<p>The other growled an acceptance, whereupon the
	nurse smiled an ironic benediction and moved away.</p>

	<p>“Where did you get it?” asked Penworthy.</p>

	<p>Doggie gave the information and, in his turn, made
	the polite counter-inquiry.</p>

	<p>Penworthy’s bit of shrapnel, which had broken a
	rib or two, had been acquired just north of Albert.
	When he left, he said, we were putting it over in
	great quantities.</p>

	<p>“That’s where the great push is going to be in a
	few days.”</p>

	<p>“Aren’t you sorry you’re out of it?”</p>

	<p>“Me?” The Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantryman
	<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235"> </a>shook his head. “I take things as I finds
	’em, and I finds this quite good enough.”</p>

	<p>So they chatted and, in the soldier’s way, became
	friends. Later, the surgeon arrived and probed
	Doggie’s wound and hurt him exquisitely, so that the
	perspiration stood out on his forehead, and his jaws
	ached afterwards from his clenching of them. While
	his leg was being dressed he reflected that, a couple
	of years ago, if anyone had inflicted a twentieth part
	of such torture on him he would have yelled the house
	down. He remembered, with an inward grin, the
	anguished precautions on which he had insisted whenever
	he sat down in the chair of his expensive London
	dentist.</p>

	<p>“It must have hurt like fun,” said the nurse, busily
	engaged with the gauze dressing.</p>

	<p>“It’s all in the day’s work,” replied Doggie.</p>

	<p>The nurse pinned the bandage and settled him
	comfortably in bed.</p>

	<p>“No one will worry you till dinner-time. You’d
	better try to have a sleep.”</p>

	<p>So Doggie nodded and smiled and curled up as
	best he could and slept the heavy sleep of the tired
	young animal. It was only when he awoke, physically
	rested and comparatively free from pain, that his
	mind, hitherto confused, began to work clearly, to
	straighten out the three days’ tangle. Yes, just three
	days. A fact almost impossible to realize. Till now
	it had seemed an eternity.</p>

	<p>He lay with his arms crossed under his head and
	stared at the blue sky—a soft, comforting English
	sky. The ward was silent. Only two beds were
	occupied, one by a man asleep, the other by a man
	reading a novel. His other room-mates, including
	his neighbour Penworthy, were so far convalescent
	<a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236"> </a>as to be up and away, presumably by the life-giving
	sea, whose rhythmic murmur he could hear. For
	the first time since he awoke to find himself bandaged
	up in a strange dug-out, and surrounded by strange
	faces, did the chaos of his ideas resolve itself into
	anything like definite memories. Yet many of them
	were still vague.</p>

	<p>He had been out there, with the wiring party, in
	the dark. He had been glad, he remembered, to
	escape from the prison of the trench into the open
	air. He was having some difficulty with a recalcitrant
	bit of wire that refused to come straight and jabbed
	him diabolically in unexpected places, when a shot
	rang out and German flares went up and everybody
	lay flat on the ground, while bullets spat about them.
	As he lay on his stomach, a flare lit up the ruined
	well of the farm of La Folette. And the well and
	his nose and his heels were in a bee-line. The
	realization of the fact was the inception of a fascinating
	idea. He remembered that quite clearly. Of course
	his discovery, two days before, of the spot where
	Jeanne’s fortune lay hidden, when Captain Willoughby,
	with map and periscope, had called him into consultation,
	had set his heart beating and his imagination
	working. But not till that moment of stark opportunity
	had he dreamed of the mad adventure which
	he undertook. There in front of him, at the very
	farthest three hundred yards away, in bee-line with
	nose and heels—that was the peculiar and particular
	arresting fact—lay Jeanne’s fortune. In thinking of
	it he lost count of shots and star-shells, and heard no
	orders and saw no dim forms creeping back to the
	safety of the trench. And then all was darkness and
	silence.</p>

	<p>Doggie lay on his back and stared at the English
	<a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237"> </a>sky and wondered how he did it. His attitude was
	that of a man who cannot reconcile his sober self
	with the idiot hero of a drunken freak. And yet, at
	the time, the journey to the ruined well seemed the
	simplest thing in the world. The thought of Jeanne’s
	delight shone uppermost in his mind…. Oh! he
	was forgetting the star, which hung low beneath a
	canopy of cloud, the extreme point of the famous
	feet, nose and well bee-line. He made for it, now
	and then walking low, now and then crawling. He
	did not mind his clothes and hands being torn by the
	unseen refuse of No Man’s Land. His chief sensation
	was one of utter loneliness, mingled with exultance
	at freedom. He did not remember feeling afraid:
	which was odd, because when the star-shells had gone
	up and the German trenches had opened fire on the
	wiring party, his blood had turned to water and his
	heart had sunk into his boots and he had been deucedly
	frightened.</p>

	<p>Heaven must have guided him straight to the well.
	He had known all along that he merely would have
	to stick his hand down to find the rope … and he
	felt no surprise when the rope actually came in contact
	with his groping fingers; no surprise when he
	pulled and pulled and fished up the packet. It had
	all been preordained. That was the funny part of
	the business which Doggie now could not understand.
	But he remembered that when he had buttoned his
	tunic over the precious packet, he had been possessed
	of an insane desire to sing and dance. He repressed
	his desire to sing, but he leaped about and started to
	run. Then the star in which he trusted must have
	betrayed him. It must have shed upon him a ray
	just strong enough to make him a visible object;
	for, suddenly, <em>ping!</em> something hit him violently on
	<a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238"> </a>the leg and bowled him over like a rabbit into a providential
	shell-hole. And there he lay quaking for a
	long time, while the lunacy of his adventure coarsely
	and unsentimentally revealed itself.</p>

	<p>As to the rest, he was in a state of befogged memory.
	Only one incident in that endless, cruel crawl home
	remained as a landmark in his mind. He had paused
	to take breath, almost ready to give up the impossible
	flight—it seemed as though he were dragging behind
	him a ton of red-hot iron—when he became conscious
	of a stench violent in his nostrils. He put out a
	hand. It encountered a horrible, once human face,
	and his fingers touched a round recognizable cap.
	Horror drove him away from the dead German and
	inspired him with the strength of despair…. Then
	all was fog and dark again until he recovered consciousness
	in the strange dug-out.</p>

	<p>There the doctor had said to him: “You must
	have a cast-iron constitution, my lad.”</p>

	<p>The memory caused a flicker round his lips. It
	wasn’t everybody who could crawl on his belly for
	nearly a quarter of a mile with a bullet through his
	leg, and come up smiling at the end of it. A cast-iron
	constitution! If he had only known it fifteen, even
	ten years ago, what a different life he might have led.
	The great disgrace would never have come upon him.</p>

	<p>And Jeanne? What of Jeanne? After he had
	told his story, they had given him to understand that
	an officer would be sent to Frélus to corroborate it,
	and, if he found it true, that Jeanne would enter
	into possession of her packet. And that was all he
	knew, for they had bundled him out of the front
	trenches as quickly as possible; and once out he had
	become a case, a stretcher case, and although he had
	been treated, as a case, with almost superhuman tenderness,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239"> </a>not a soul regarded him as a human being with
	a personality or a history—not even with a military
	history. And this same military history had vaguely
	worried him all the time, and now that he could
	think clearly, worried him with a very definite worry.
	In leaving his firing-party he had been guilty of a
	crime. Every misdemeanour in the Army is termed
	a crime—from murder to appearing buttonless on
	parade. Was it desertion? If so, he might be shot.
	He had not thought of that when he started on his quest.
	It had seemed so simple to account for half an hour’s
	absence by saying that he had lost his way in the dark.
	But now, that plausible excuse was invalid….</p>

	<p>Doggie thought terribly hard that quiet, sea-scented
	morning. After all, it did not very much matter
	what they did to him. Sticking him up against a
	wall and shooting him was a remote possibility; he
	was in the British and not the German Army. Field
	punishments of unpleasant kinds were only inflicted
	on people convicted of unpleasant delinquencies. If
	he were a sergeant or a corporal, he doubtless would
	be broken. But such is the fortunate position of a
	private, that he cannot be degraded to an inferior
	rank. At the worst they might give him cells when
	he recovered. Well, he could stick it. It didn’t
	matter. What really mattered was Jeanne. Was
	she in undisputed possession of her packet? When
	it was a question of practical warfare, Doggie had
	blind faith in his officers—a faith perhaps even more
	childlike than that of his fellow-privates, for officers
	were the men who had come through the ordeal in
	which he had so lamentably failed; but when it
	came to administrative affairs, he was more critical.
	He had suffered during his military career from more
	than one subaltern on whose arid consciousness the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240"> </a>brain-wave never beat. He had never met even a
	field officer before whom, in the realm of intellect,
	he had stood in awe. If any one of those dimly
	envisaged and still more dimly remembered officers
	of the Lancashire Fusiliers had ordered him to stand
	on his head on top of the parapet, he would have
	obeyed in cheerful confidence; but he was not at
	all certain that, in the effort to deliver the packet to
	Jeanne, they would not make an unholy mess of
	things. He saw stacks of dirty yellowish bits of
	paper, with A.F. No. something or the other, floating
	between Frélus and the Lancashire Battalion H.Q.
	and the Brigade H.Q. and the Divisional H.Q., and
	so on through the majesty of G.H.Q. to the awful
	War Office itself. In pessimistic mood he thought
	that if Jeanne recovered her property within a year,
	she would be lucky.</p>

	<p>What a wonderful creature was Jeanne! He shut
	his eyes to the blue sky and pictured her as she stood in
	the light, on the ragged escarpment, with her garments
	beaten by wind and rain. And he remembered the
	weary thud, thud of railway and steamer, which had
	resolved itself, like the rhythmic tramp of feet that
	night, into the ceaseless refrain: “Jeanne! Jeanne!”</p>

	<p>He opened his eyes again and frowned at the blue
	English sky. It had no business to proclaim simple
	serenity when his mind was in such a state of complex
	tangle. It was all very well to think of Jeanne—Jeanne,
	whom it was unlikely that Fate would ever
	allow him to see again, even supposing the war ended
	during his lifetime; but there was Peggy—Peggy, his
	future wife, who had stuck to him loyally through good
	and evil repute. Yes, there was Peggy—not the
	faintest shadow of doubt about it. Doggie kept on
	frowning at the blue sky. Blighty was a very desirable
	<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241"> </a>country, but in it you were compelled to think. And
	enforced thought was an infernal nuisance. The
	beastly trenches had their good points after all. There
	you were not called upon to think of anything; the
	less you thought, the better for your job; you just
	ate your bully-beef and drank your tea and cursed
	whizz-bangs and killed a rat or two, and thanked
	God you were alive.</p>

	<p>Now that he came to look at it in proper perspective,
	it wasn’t at all a bad life. When had he been worried
	to death, as he was now? And there were his friends:
	the humorous, genial, deboshed, yet ever-kindly
	Phineas; dear old Mo Shendish, whose material feet
	were hankering after the vulgar pavement of Mare
	Street, Hackney, but whose spiritual tread rang on
	golden floors dimly imagined by the Seer of Patmos;
	Barrett, the D. C. M., the miniature Hercules, who,
	according to legend, though, modestly, he would never
	own to it, seized two Boches by the neck and knocked
	their heads together till they died, and who, musically
	inclined, would sit at his, Doggie’s, feet while he played
	on his penny whistle all the sentimental tunes he had
	ever heard of; Sergeant Ballinghall, a tower of a
	man, a champion amateur heavy-weight boxer, with
	a voice compared with which a megaphone sounded
	like a maiden’s prayer, and a Bardolphian nose and
	an eagle eye and the heart of a broody hen, who had
	not only given him boxing lessons, but had pulled
	him through difficult places innumerable … and
	scores of others. He wondered what they were doing.
	He also was foolish enough to wonder whether they
	missed him, forgetting for the moment that if a regiment
	took seriously to missing their comrades sent
	to Kingdom Come or Blighty, they would be more
	like weeping willows than destroyers of Huns.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242"> </a>All the same, he knew that he would always live
	in the hearts of two or three of them, and the knowledge
	brought him considerable comfort. It was
	strange to realize how the tentacles of his being
	stretched out gropingly towards these (from the old
	Durdlebury point of view) impossible friends. They
	had grafted themselves on to his life. Or was that
	a correct way of putting it? Had they not, rather,
	all grafted themselves on to a common stock of life,
	so that the one common sap ran through all their
	veins?</p>

	<p>It took him a long time to get this idea formulated,
	fixed and accepted. But Doggie was not one to
	boggle at the truth, as he saw it. And this was the
	truth. He, James Marmaduke Trevor of Denby
	Hall, was a Tommy of the Tommies. He had lived
	the Tommy life intensely. He was living it now.
	And the extraordinary part of it was that he didn’t
	want to be anything else but a Tommy. From the
	social or gregarious point of view his life for the past
	year had been one of unclouded happiness. The
	realization of it, now that he was clearly sizing up
	the ramshackle thing which he called his existence,
	hit him like the butt-end of a rifle. Hardship, cold,
	hunger, fatigue, stench, rats, the dread of inefficiency—all
	these had been factors of misery which he could
	never eliminate from his soldier’s equation; but such
	free, joyous, intimate companionship with real human
	beings he had never enjoyed since he was born. He
	longed to be back among them, doing the same old
	weary, dreary, things, eating the same old Robinson
	Crusoe kind of food, crouching with them in the same
	old beastly hole in the ground, while the Boche let
	loose hell on the trench. Mo Shendish’s grin and
	his “’Ere, get in aht of the rain,” and his grip on his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243"> </a>shoulder, dragging him a few inches farther into
	shelter, were a spiritual compensation transcending
	physical discomfitures and perils.</p>

	<p>“It’s all dam funny,” he said half aloud.</p>

	<p>But this was England, and although he was hedged
	about, protected and restricted by War Office Regulation
	Red Tape twisted round to the strength of steel
	cables, yet he was in command of telegraphs, of telephones,
	and, in a secondary degree, of the railway
	system of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p>He found himself deprecating the compulsory facilities
	of communication in the civilized world. The
	Deanery must be informed of his home-coming.</p>

	<p>As soon as he could secure the services of a nurse
	he wrote out three telegrams: one addressed “Conover,
	The Deanery, Durdlebury”; one to Peddle
	at Denby Hall, and one to Jeanne. The one to
	Jeanne was the longest, and was “Reply paid.”</p>

	<p>“This is going to cost a small fortune, young man,”
	said the nurse.</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled as he drew out a £1 treasury note
	from his soldier’s pocket-book, the pathetic object
	containing a form of Will on the right-hand flap and
	on the left the directions for the making of the Will,
	concluding with the world-famous typical signature
	of Thomas Atkins.</p>

	<p>“It’s a bust, Sister,” said he. “I’ve been saving
	up for it for months.”</p>

	<p>Then, duty accomplished, he reconciled himself
	to the corner of fairyland in which he had awoke
	that morning. Things must take their course, and
	while they were taking it, why worry? So long as
	they didn’t commit the outrage of giving him bully-beef
	for dinner, the present coolness and comfort
	sufficed for his happiness.</p>

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> replies to the telegrams were satisfactory.
	Peggy, adjuring him to write a full account
	of himself, announced her intention of coming up to
	see him as soon as he could guarantee his fitness to
	receive visitors. Jeanne wired: “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paquet reçu. Mille
	remerciements.</em>” The news cheered him exceedingly.
	It was worth a hole in the leg. Henceforward Jeanne
	would be independent of Aunt Morin, of whose
	generous affection, in spite of Jeanne’s loyal reticence,
	he had formed but a poor opinion. Now the old
	lady could die whenever she liked, and so much the
	better for Jeanne. Jeanne would then be freed from
	the unhealthy sick-room, from dreary little Frélus,
	and from enforced consorting with the riff-raff (namely,
	all other regiments except his own) of the British
	Army. Even as it was, he did not enjoy thinking
	of her as hail-fellow-well-met with his own fellow-privates—perhaps
	with the exception of Phineas and
	Mo, who were in a different position, having been
	formally admitted into a peculiar intimacy. Of course,
	if Doggie had possessed a more analytical mind, he
	would have been greatly surprised to discover that
	these feelings arose from a healthy, barbaric sense of
	ownership of Jeanne; that Mo and Phineas were
	in a special position because they humbly recognized
	this fact of ownership and adopted a respectful attitude
	towards his property, and that of all other predatory
	men in uniform he was distrustful and jealous. But
	<a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245"> </a>Doggie was a simple soul and went through a great
	many elementary emotions, just as Monsieur Jourdain
	spoke prose, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans le savoir</em>. Without knowing it, he
	would have gone to the ends of the earth for Jeanne,
	have clubbed over the head any fellow-savage who
	should seek to rob him of Jeanne. It did not occur
	to him that savage instinct had already sent him into
	the jaws of death, solely in order to establish his
	primitive man’s ownership of Jeanne. When he came
	to reflect, in his Doggie-ish way, on the motives of
	his exploit, he was somewhat baffled. Jeanne, with
	her tragic face, and her tragic history, and her steadfast
	soul shining out of her eyes, was the most wonderful
	woman he had ever met. She personified the heroic
	womanhood of France. The foul invader had robbed
	her of her family and her patrimony. The dead
	were dead, and could not be restored; but the material
	wealth, God—who else?—had given him this miraculous
	chance to recover; and he had recovered it.
	National pride helped to confuse issues. He, an
	Englishman, had saved this heroic daughter of France
	from poverty….</p>

	<p>If only he could have won back to his own trench,
	and, later, when the company returned to Frélus,
	he could have handed her the packet and seen the
	light come into those wonderful eyes!</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Anyhow, she had received it. She sent him a
	thousand thanks. How did she look, what did she
	say when she cut the string and undid the seals and
	found her little fortune?</p>

	<p>Translate Jeanne into a princess, the dirty waterproof
	package into a golden casket, himself into a
	knight disguised as a squire of low degree, and what
	more could you want for a first-class fairy-tale? The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page246" title="246"> </a>idea struck Doggie at the moment of “lights out,”
	and he laughed aloud.</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t take much to amuse some people,”
	growled his neighbour, Penworthy.</p>

	<p>“Sign of a happy disposition,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“What’ve you got to be happy about?”</p>

	<p>“I was thinking how alive we are, and how dead
	you and I might be,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Well, I don’t think it funny thinking how one
	might be dead,” replied Penworthy. “It gives me
	the creeps. It’s all very well for you. You’ll stump
	around for the rest of your life like a gentleman on
	a wooden leg. Chaps like you have all the luck;
	but as soon as I get out of this, I’ll be passed fit for
	active service … and not so much of your larfing
	at not being dead. See?”</p>

	<p>“All right, mate,” said Doggie. “Good night.”</p>

	<p>Penworthy made no immediate reply; but presently
	he broke out:</p>

	<p>“What d’you mean by talking like that? I’d
	hate being dead.”</p>

	<p>A voice from the far end of the room luridly requested
	that the conversation should cease. Silence
	reigned.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">A letter from Jeanne. The envelope bore a French
	stamp with the Frélus postmark, and the address was
	in a bold feminine hand. From whom could it be
	but Jeanne? His heart gave a ridiculous leap and
	he tore the envelope open as he had never torn open
	envelope of Peggy’s. But at the first two words the
	leap seemed to be one in mid-air, and his heart went
	down, down, down like an aeroplane done in, and
	arrived with a hideous bump upon rocks.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Monsieur</em>”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page247" title="247"> </a><em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Monsieur</em> from Jeanne—Jeanne who had
	called him “Dog-gie” in accents that had rendered
	adorable the once execrated syllables. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Monsieur!</em></p>

	<p>And the following, in formal French—it might
	have been a convent exercise in composition—is what
	she said:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“The military authorities have remitted into my
		possession the package which you so heroically rescued
		from the well of the farm of La Folette. It contains
		all that my father was able to save of his fortune, and
		on consultation with Maître Pépineau here, it appears
		that I have sufficient to live modestly for the rest of
		my life. For the marvellous devotion of you, monsieur,
		an English gentleman, to the poor interests of
		an obscure young French girl, I can never be sufficiently
		grateful. There will never be a prayer of
		mine, until I die, in which you will not be mentioned.
		To me it will be always a symbolic act of your chivalrous
		England in the aid of my beloved France. That
		you have been wounded in this noble and selfless
		enterprise, is to me a subject both of pride and terrifying
		dismay. I am moved to the depths of my being.
		But I have been assured, and your telegram confirms
		the assurance, that your wound is not dangerous.
		If you had been killed while rendering me this wonderful
		service, or incapacitated so that you could no
		longer strike a blow for your country and mine, I
		should never have forgiven myself. I should have
		felt that I had robbed France of a heroic defender.
		I pray God that you may soon recover, and in fighting
		once more against our common enemy, you may
		win the glory that no English soldier can deserve
		more than you. Forgive me if I express badly the
		emotions which overwhelm me. It is impossible
		<a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248"> </a>that we shall meet again. One of the few English
		novels I have tried to read, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à coups de dictionnaire</em>,
		was <cite>Ships that Pass in the Night</cite>. In spite
		of the great thing that you have done for me, it is
		inevitable that we should be such passing vessels. It
		is life. If, as I shall ceaselessly pray, you survive
		this terrible war, you will follow your destiny as an
		Englishman of high position, and I that which God
		marks out for me.</p>

		<p>“I ask you to accept again the expression of my
		imperishable gratitude. Adieu.</p>

		<p class="signature">“<span class="name">Jeanne Bossière.</span>”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The more often Doggie read this perfectly phrased
	epistle, the greater waxed his puzzledom. The
	gratitude was all there; more than enough. It was
	gratitude and nothing else. He had longed for a
	human story telling just how the thing had happened,
	just how Jeanne had felt. He had wanted her to
	say: “Get well soon and come back, and I’ll tell
	you all about it.” But instead of that she dwelt on
	the difference of their social status, loftily announced
	that they would never meet again and that they would
	follow different destinies, and bade him the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieu</em>
	which in French is the final leave-taking. All of
	which to Doggie, the unsophisticated, would have
	seemed ridiculous, had it not been so tragic. He
	couldn’t reconcile the beautiful letter, written in
	faultless handwriting and impeccable French, with the
	rain-swept girl on the escarpment. What did she
	mean? What had come over her?</p>

	<p>But the ways of Jeannes are not the ways of Doggies.
	How was he to know of the boastings of Phineas
	McPhail, and the hopelessness with which they filled
	Jeanne’s heart? How was he to know that she had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page249" title="249"> </a>sat up most of the night in her little room over the
	gateway, drafting and redrafting this precious composition,
	until, having reduced it to soul-devastating
	correctitude, and, with aching eyes and head, made a
	fair and faultless copy, she had once more cried herself
	into miserable slumber?</p>

	<p>At once Doggie called for pad and pencil, and
	began to write:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“My dear Jeanne,—</p>

		<p>“I don’t understand. What fly has stung you?
		(<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle mouche vous a piquée?</em>) Of course we shall
		meet again. Do you suppose I am going to let you
		go out of my life?”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>(He sucked his pencil. Jeanne must be spoken to
	severely.)</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“What rubbish are you talking about my social
		position? My father was an English parson (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteur
		anglais</em>) and yours a French lawyer. If I have a
		little money of my own, so have you. And we are
		not ships and we have not passed in the night. And
		that we should not meet again is not Life. It is
		absurdity. We are going to meet as soon as wounds
		and war will let me, and I am not your ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Monsieur</em>,’
		but your ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Dog-gie</em>,’ and——”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>“Here is a letter for you, brought by hand,” said
	the nurse, bustling to his bedside.</p>

	<p>It was from Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Oh, lord!” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Peggy was there. She had arrived from Durdlebury
	all alone, the night before, and was putting up
	at an hotel. The venerable idiot, with red crosses
	and bits of tin all over her, who seemed to run the
	hospital, wouldn’t let her in to see him till the regulation
	<a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250"> </a>visiting hour of three o’clock. That she, Peggy,
	was a Dean’s daughter, who had travelled hundreds
	of miles to see the man she was engaged to, did not
	seem to impress the venerable idiot in the least. Till
	three o’clock then. With love from Peggy.</p>

	<p>“The lady, I believe, is waiting for an answer,”
	said the nurse.</p>

	<p>“Oh, my hat!” said Doggie below his breath.</p>

	<p>To write the answer, he had to strip from the pad
	the page on which he had begun the letter to Jeanne.
	He wrote: “Dearest Peggy.” Then the pencil-point’s
	impress through the thin paper stared at him.
	Almost every word was decipherable. Recklessly he
	tore the pad in half and on a virgin page scribbled his
	message to Peggy. The nurse departed with it. He
	took up the flimsy sheet containing his interrupted
	letter to Jeanne and glanced at it in dismay. For
	the first time it struck him that such words, to a
	girl even of the lowest intelligence, could only have
	one interpretation. Doggie said, “Oh, lord!” and
	“Oh, my hat!” and Oh all sorts of unprintable
	things that he had learned in the army. And he
	put to himself the essential question: What the Hades
	was he playing at?</p>

	<p>Obviously, the first thing to do was to destroy the
	letter to Jeanne and the tell-tale impress. This he
	forthwith did. He tore the sheets into the tiniest
	fragments, stretched out his arm to put the handful
	on the table by the bed, missed his aim and dropped it
	on the floor. Whereby he incurred the just wrath
	of the hard-worked nurse.</p>

	<p>Again he took up Jeanne’s letter. After all, what
	was wrong with it? He must look at things from
	her point of view. What had really happened? Let
	him set out the facts judicially. They had struck up
	<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251"> </a>a day or two’s friendship. She had told him, as she
	might have told any decent soul, her sad and romantic
	story. The English during the great retreat had
	rendered her unforgettable services. She was a girl
	of a generously responsive nature. She would pay
	her debt of gratitude to the English soldier. Her
	fine <em>vale</em> on the memorable night of rain was part
	payment of her debt to England. Yes. Let him get
	things in the right perspective…. She had made
	friends with him because he was one of the few private
	soldiers who could speak her language. It was but
	natural that she should tell him of the sunken packet.
	It was one of the most vital facts of her life. But
	just an outside fact: nothing to do with any shy
	mysterious workings of her woman’s soul. She might
	have told the story to any man in the company without
	derogation from her womanly dignity. And any
	man Jack of them, having Jeanne’s confidence, having
	the knowledge of the situation of the ruined well,
	having the God-sent opportunity of recovering the
	treasure, would, of absolute certainty, have done
	exactly what he, Doggie, had done. Supposing Mo
	Shendish had been the privileged person, instead of
	himself. What, by way of thanks, could Jeanne have
	written?  A letter practically identical.</p>

	<p>Practically. A very comfortable sort of word; but
	Doggie’s cultivated mind disliked it. It was a slovenly
	word, a makeshift for the hard broom of clean thought.
	This infernal “practically” begged the whole question.
	Jeanne would not have sentimentalized to Mo
	Shendish about ships passing in the night. No, she
	wouldn’t, in spite of all his efforts to persuade himself
	that she would. Well, perhaps dear old Mo was a
	rough, uneducated sort of chap. He could not have
	established with Jeanne such delicate relations of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252"> </a>friendship as exist between social equals. Obviously
	the finer shades of her letter would have varied according
	to the personality of the recipient. Jeanne and
	himself, owing to the abnormal conditions of war,
	had suddenly become very intimate friends. The
	war, as she imagined, must part them for ever. She
	bade him a touching and dignified farewell, and that
	was the end of the matter. It had all been an idyllic
	episode; beginning, middle, and end; neatly rounded
	off; a thing done, and done with—except as a strange
	romantic memory. It was all over. As long as he
	remained in the army, a condition for which, as a
	private soldier, he was not responsible, how could he
	see Jeanne again? By the time he rejoined, the
	regiment would be many miles away from Frélus.
	This, in her clear, steady way, she realized. Her
	letter must be final.</p>

	<p>It had to be final. Was not Peggy coming at
	three o’clock?</p>

	<p>Again Doggie thought, somewhat wistfully, of the
	old care-free, full physical life, and again he murmured:</p>

	<p>“It’s all dam funny!”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Peggy stood for a moment at the door scanning
	the ward; then perceiving him, she marched down
	with a defiant glance at nurses and blue-uniformed
	comrades and men in bed and other strangers, swung
	a chair and established herself by his bedside.</p>

	<p>“You dear old thing, I couldn’t bear to think of
	you lying here alone,” she said, with the hurry that
	seeks to cover shyness. “I had to come. Mother’s
	gone <em>fut</em> and can’t travel, and Dad’s running all the
	parsons’ shows in the district. Otherwise one of
	them would have come too.”</p>

	<p>“It’s awfully good of you, Peggy,” he said, with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253"> </a>a smile, for fair and flushed she was pleasant to look
	upon. “But it must have been a fiendish journey.”</p>

	<p>“Rotten!” said Peggy. “But that’s a trifle.
	You’re the all-important thing. Tell me straight.
	You’re not badly hurt, are you?”</p>

	<p>“Lord, no,” he replied cheerfully. “Just the
	fleshy part of the leg—a clean bullet-wound. Bone
	touched; but they say I’ll be fit quite soon.”</p>

	<p>“Sure? They’re not going to cut off your leg
	or do anything horrid?”</p>

	<p>He laughed. “Sure,” said he.</p>

	<p>“That’s all right.”</p>

	<p>There was a pause. Now that they had met they
	seemed to have little to say. She looked around.
	Presently she remarked:</p>

	<p>“Everything looks quite fresh and clean.”</p>

	<p>“It’s perfect.”</p>

	<p>“Rather public, though,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Publicity is the paradoxical condition of the
	private’s life,” laughed Doggie.</p>

	<p>Another pause.</p>

	<p>“Well, how are you feeling?”</p>

	<p>“First-rate,” said Doggie. “It’s nothing to fuss
	over. I hope to be out again in a month or two.”</p>

	<p>“Out where?”</p>

	<p>“In France—with the regiment.”</p>

	<p>Peggy drew a little breath of astonishment and sat
	up on her chair. His surprising statement seemed to
	have broken up the atmosphere of restraint.</p>

	<p>“Do you mean to say you <em>want</em> to go back to the
	trenches?”</p>

	<p>Conscientious Doggie knitted his brows. A fervent
	“Yes” would proclaim him a modern Paladin, eager
	to slay Huns. Now, as a patriotic Englishman he
	loved Huns to be slain, but as the survivor of James
	<a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254"> </a>Marmaduke Trevor, dilettante expert on the theorbo
	and the viol da gamba and owner of the peacock and
	ivory room in Denby Hall, to say nothing of the
	collector of little china dogs, he could not honestly
	declare that he enjoyed the various processes of slaying
	them.</p>

	<p>“I can’t explain,” he replied, after a while.
	“When I was out, I thought I hated every minute
	of it. Now I look back, I find I’ve had quite a good
	time. I’ve not once really been sick or sorry. For
	instance, I’ve often thought myself beastly miserable
	with wet and mud and east wind—but I’ve never
	had even a cold in the head. I never knew how good
	it was to feel fit. And there are other things. When
	I left Durdlebury, I hadn’t a man friend in the world.
	Now I have a lot of wonderful pals who would go
	through hell for one another—and for me.”</p>

	<p>“Tommies?”</p>

	<p>“Of course—Tommies.”</p>

	<p>“You mean gentlemen in the ranks?”</p>

	<p>“Not a bit of it. Or yes. All are gentlemen in
	the ranks. All sorts and conditions of men. The
	man whom I honour and love more than anyone else,
	comes from a fish-shop in Hackney. That’s the
	fascinating part of it. Do understand me, Peggy,”
	he continued, after a short silence, during which she
	regarded him almost uncomprehendingly. “I don’t
	say I’m yearning to sleep in a filthy dug out or to
	wallow in the ground under shell-fire, or anything of
	that sort. That’s beastly. There’s only one other
	word for it, which begins with the same letter, and
	the superior kind of private doesn’t use it in ladies’
	society…. But while I’m lying here I wonder
	what all the other fellows are doing—they’re such
	good chaps—real, true, clean men—out there you
	<a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255"> </a>seem to get to essentials—all the rest is leather and
	prunella—and I want to be back among them again.
	Why should I be in clover while they’re in choking
	dust—a lot of it composed of desiccated Boches?”</p>

	<p>“How horrid!” cried Peggy, with a little shiver.</p>

	<p>“Of course it’s horrid. But they’ve got to stick
	it, haven’t they? And then there’s another thing.
	Out there one hasn’t any worries.”</p>

	<p>Peggy pricked up her ears. “Worries? What
	kind of worries?”</p>

	<p>Doggie became conscious of indiscretion. He
	temporized.</p>

	<p>“Oh, all kinds. Every man with a sort of trained
	intellect must have them. You remember John
	Stuart Mill’s problem: ‘Which would you sooner
	be—a contented hog, or a discontented philosopher?’
	At the Front you have all the joys of the contented
	hog.”</p>

	<p>Instinctively he stretched out his hand for a cigarette.
	She bent forward, gripped a matchbox, and lit the
	cigarette for him.</p>

	<p>Doggie thanked her politely; but in a dim way
	he felt conscious of something lacking in her little
	act of helpfulness. It had been performed with the
	unsmiling perfunctoriness of the nurse; an act of
	duty, not of tenderness. As she blew out the match,
	which she did with an odd air of deliberation, her face
	wore the same expression of hardness it had done
	on that memorable day when she had refused him her
	sympathy over the white feather incident.</p>

	<p>“I can’t understand your wanting to go back at
	all. Surely you’ve done your bit,” she said.</p>

	<p>“No one has done his bit who’s alive and able to
	carry on,” replied Doggie.</p>

	<p>Peggy reflected. Yes. There was some truth in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256"> </a>that. But she thought it rather hard lines on the
	wounded to be sent back as soon as they were patched
	up. Most of them hated the prospect. That was
	why she couldn’t understand Doggie’s desire.</p>

	<p>“Anyhow, it’s jolly noble of you, dear old thing,”
	she declared with rather a spasmodic change of manner,
	“and I’m very proud of you.”</p>

	<p>“For God’s sake, don’t go imagining me a hero,”
	cried Doggie in alarm, “for I’m not. I hate the
	fighting like poison. The only reason I don’t run
	away is because I can’t. It would be far more
	dangerous than standing still. It would mean an
	officer’s bullet through my head at once.”</p>

	<p>“Any man who is wounded in the defence of his
	country is a hero,” said Peggy defiantly.</p>

	<p>“Rot!” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“And all this time you haven’t told me how you
	got it. How did you?”</p>

	<p>Doggie squirmed. The inevitable and dreaded
	question had come at last.</p>

	<p>“I just got sniped when I was out, at night, with
	a wiring party,” he said hurriedly.</p>

	<p>“But that’s no description at all,” she objected.</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid it’s all I can give,” Doggie replied.
	Then, by way of salve to a sensitive conscience, he
	added: “There was nothing brave or heroic about
	it, at all—just a silly accident. It was as safe as tying
	up hollyhocks in a garden. Only an idiot Boche let
	off his gun on spec and got me. Don’t let us talk
	about it.”</p>

	<p>But Peggy was insistent. “I’m not such a fool
	as not to know what mending barbed wire at night
	means. And whatever you may say, you got wounded
	in the service of your country.”</p>

	<p>It was on Doggie’s agitated lips to shout a true
	<a class="pagenum" id="page257" title="257"> </a>“I didn’t!” For that was the devil of it. Had
	he been so wounded, he could have purred contentedly
	while accepting the genuine hero’s meed of homage
	and consolation. But he had left his country’s service
	to enter that of Jeanne. In her service he had been
	shot through the leg. He had no business to be
	wounded at all. Jeanne saw that very clearly. To
	have exposed himself to the risk of his exploit was
	contrary to all his country’s interests. His wound
	had robbed her of a fighting man, not a particularly
	valuable warrior, but a soldier in the firing line all
	the same. If every man went off like that on private
	missions of his own and got properly potted, there
	would be the end of the Army. It was horrible to
	be an interesting hero under false pretences.</p>

	<p>Of course he might have been George Washingtonian
	enough to shout: “I cannot tell a lie. I
	didn’t.” But that would have meant relating the
	whole story of Jeanne. And would Peggy have understood
	the story of Jeanne? Could Peggy, in her
	plain-sailing, breezy British way, have appreciated all
	the subtleties of his relations with Jeanne? She would
	ask pointed, probably barbed, questions about Jeanne.
	She would tear the whole romance to shreds. Jeanne
	stood too exquisite a symbol for him to permit the
	sacrilege of Peggy’s ruthless vivisection. For vivisect
	she would, without shadow of doubt. His long and
	innocent familiarity with womankind in Durdlebury
	had led him instinctively to the conclusion formulated
	by one of the world’s greatest cynics in his advice
	to a young man: “If you care for happiness, never
	speak to a woman about another woman.”</p>

	<p>Doggie felt uncomfortable as he looked into Peggy’s
	clear blue eyes; not conscience-stricken at the realization
	of himself as a scoundrelly Don Juan—that never
	<a class="pagenum" id="page258" title="258"> </a>entered his ingenuous mind; but he hated his enforced
	departure from veracity. The one virtue that had
	dragged the toy Pom successfully along the Rough
	Road of the soldier’s life was his uncompromising
	attitude to Truth. It cost him a sharp struggle with
	his soul to reply to Peggy:</p>

	<p>“All right. Have it so if it pleases you, my dear.
	But it was an idiot fluke all the same.”</p>

	<p>“I wonder if you know how you’ve changed,”
	she said, after a while.</p>

	<p>“For better or worse?”</p>

	<p>“The obvious thing to say would be ‘for the
	better.’ But I wonder. Do you mind if I’m
	frank?”</p>

	<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

	<p>“There’s something hard about you, Marmaduke.”</p>

	<p>Doggie wrinkled lips and brow in a curious smile.
	“I’ll be frank too. You see, I’ve been living among
	men, instead of a pack of old women.”</p>

	<p>“I suppose that’s it,” Peggy said thoughtfully.</p>

	<p>“It’s a dud sort of place, Durdlebury,” said he.</p>

	<p>“Dud?”</p>

	<p>He laughed. “It never goes off.”</p>

	<p>“You used to say, in your letters, that you longed
	for it.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps I do now—in a way. I don’t know.”</p>

	<p>“I bet you’ll settle down there after the war,
	just as though nothing had happened.”</p>

	<p>“I wonder,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Of course you will. Do you remember our
	plans for the reconstruction of Denby Hall, which
	were knocked on the head? All that’ll have to be
	gone into again.”</p>

	<p>“That doesn’t mean that we need curl ourselves
	up there for ever like caterpillars in a cabbage.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page259" title="259"> </a>She arched her eyebrows. “What would you like
	to do?”</p>

	<p>“I think I’ll want to go round and round the world
	till I’m dizzy.”</p>

	<p>At this amazing pronouncement from Marmaduke
	Trevor, Peggy gasped. It also astonished Doggie
	himself. He had not progressed so far on the road
	to self-emancipation as to dream of a rupture of his
	engagement. His marriage was as much a decree of
	destiny as had been his enlistment when he walked
	to Peter Pan’s statue in Kensington Gardens. But
	the war had made the prospect a distant one. In
	the vague future he would marry and settle down.
	But now Peggy brought it into alarming nearness,
	thereby causing him considerable agitation. To go
	back to vegetation in Durdlebury, even with so desirable
	a companion cabbage as Peggy, just when he was
	beginning to conjecture what there might be of joy
	and thrill in life—the thought dismayed him; and
	the sudden dismay found expression in his rhetorical
	outburst.</p>

	<p>“Oh, if you want to travel for a year or two, I’m
	all for it,” cried Peggy. “I can’t say I’ve seen much
	of the world. But we’ll soon get sick of it, and
	yearn for home. There’ll be lots of things to do.
	We’ll take up our position as county people—no
	more of the stuffy old women you’re so down on—and
	you’ll get into Parliament and sit on committees,
	and so on, and altogether we’ll have a topping time.”</p>

	<p>Doggie had an odd sensation that a stranger spoke
	through Peggy’s familiar lips. Well, perhaps, not a
	stranger, but a half-forgotten dead and gone acquaintance.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you think the war will change things—if
	it hasn’t changed them already?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page260" title="260"> </a>“Not a bit,” Peggy replied. “Dad’s always talking
	learnedly about social reconstruction, whatever
	that means. But if people have got money and position
	and all that sort of thing, who’s going to take it away
	from them? You don’t suppose we’re all going to
	turn socialists and pool the wealth of the country, and
	everybody’s going to live in a garden-city and wear
	sandals and eat nuts?”</p>

	<p>“Of course not,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Well, how are people like ourselves going to
	feel any difference in what you call social conditions?”</p>

	<p>Doggie lit another cigarette, chiefly in order to
	gain time for thought; but an odd instinct made
	him secure the matchbox before he picked out the
	cigarette. Superficially, Peggy’s proposition was incontrovertible.
	Unless there happened some social
	cataclysm, involving a newly democratized world in
	ghastly chaos, which after all was a remote possibility,
	the externals of gentle life would undergo very slight
	modification. Yet there was something fundamentally
	wrong in Peggy’s conception of post-war existence.
	Something wrong in essentials. Now, a critical attitude
	towards Peggy, whose presence was a proof of
	her splendid loyalty, seemed hateful. But there was
	something wrong all the same. Something wrong in
	Peggy herself that put her into opposition. In one
	aspect, she was the pre-war Peggy, with her cut-and-dried
	little social ambitions and her definite projects
	of attainment; but in another she was not. The
	pre-war Peggy had swiftly turned into the patriotic
	English girl who had hounded him into the army.
	He found himself face to face with an amorphous,
	characterless sort of Peggy whom he did not know.
	It was perplexing, baffling. Before he could formulate
	an idea, she went on:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page261" title="261"> </a>“You silly old thing, what change is there likely
	to be? What change is there now, after all?
	There’s a scarcity of men. Naturally. They’re out
	fighting. But when they come home on leave, life
	goes on just the same as before—tennis parties, little
	dances, dinners. Of course, lots of people are hard
	hit. Did I tell you that Jack Paunceby was killed—the
	only son? The war’s awful and dreadful, I
	know—but if we don’t go through with it cheerfully,
	what’s the good of us?”</p>

	<p>“I think I’m pretty cheerful,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Oh, you’re not grousing and you’re making the
	best of it. You’re perfectly splendid. But you’re
	philosophizing such a lot over it. The only thing
	before us is to do in Germany, Prussian militarism,
	and so on, and then there’ll be peace, and we’ll all
	be happy again.”</p>

	<p>“Have you met many men who say that?” he
	asked.</p>

	<p>“Heaps. Oliver was only talking about it the
	other day.”</p>

	<p>“Oliver?”</p>

	<p>At his quick challenge he could not help noticing
	a little cloud, as of vexation, pass over her face.</p>

	<p>“Yes, Oliver,” she replied, with an unnecessary
	air of defiance. “He has been over here on short
	leave. Went back a fortnight ago. He’s as cheerful
	as cheerful can be. Jollier than ever he was. I took
	him out in the dear old two-seater and he insisted on
	driving to show how they drove at the Front—and
	it’s only because the Almighty must have kept a special
	eye on a Dean’s daughter that I’m here to tell the
	tale.”</p>

	<p>“You saw a lot of him, I suppose?” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>A flush rose on Peggy’s cheek. “Of course. He
	<a class="pagenum" id="page262" title="262"> </a>was staying at the Deanery most of his time. I wrote
	to you about it. I’ve made a point of telling you
	everything. I even told you about the two-seater.”</p>

	<p>“So you did,” said Doggie. “I remember.” He
	smiled. “Your description made me laugh. Oliver’s
	a major now, isn’t he?”</p>

	<p>“Yes. And just before he got his majority they
	gave him the Military Cross.”</p>

	<p>“He must be an awful swell,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>She replied with some heat. “He hasn’t changed
	the least little bit in the world.”</p>

	<p>Doggie shook his head. “No one can go through
	it, really go through it, and come back the same.”</p>

	<p>“You don’t insinuate that Oliver hasn’t really gone
	through it?”</p>

	<p>“Of course not, Peggy dear. They don’t throw
	M.C.’s about like Iron Crosses. In order to get it
	Oliver must have looked into the jaws of hell. They
	all do. But no man is the same afterwards. Oliver
	has what the French call <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">panache</em>——”</p>

	<p>“What’s <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">panache</em>?”</p>

	<p>“The real heroic swagger—something spiritual
	about it. Oliver’s not going to let you notice the
	change in him.”</p>

	<p>“We went to the Alhambra, and he laughed as
	if such a thing as war had never been heard of.”</p>

	<p>“Naturally,” said Doggie. “All that’s part of
	the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">panache</em>.”</p>

	<p>“You’re talking through your hat, Marmaduke,”
	she exclaimed with some irritation. “Oliver’s a
	straight, clean, English soldier.”</p>

	<p>“I’ve been doing my best to tell you so,” said
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>“But you seem to be criticizing him because he’s
	concealing something behind what you call his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">panache</em>.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page263" title="263"> </a>“Not criticizing, dear. Only stating. I think I’m
	more Oliverian than you.”</p>

	<p>“I’m not Oliverian,” cried Peggy, with burning
	cheeks. “And I don’t see why we should discuss
	him like this. All I said was that Oliver, who has
	made himself a distinguished man and will be even
	more distinguished, and, at any rate, knows what
	he’s talking about, doesn’t worry his head with social
	reconstruction and all that sort of rot. I’ve come
	here to talk about you, not about Oliver. Let us
	leave him out of the question.”</p>

	<p>“Willingly,” said Doggie. “I never had any
	reason to love Oliver; but I must do him justice.
	I only wanted to show you that he must be a bigger
	man than you imagine.”</p>

	<p>“I’m glad to hear you say so,” cried Peggy, with
	a flash of the eyes. “I hope it’s true.”</p>

	<p>“The war’s such a whacking big thing, you see,”
	he said with a conciliatory smile. “No one can
	prophesy exactly what’s going to come out of it.
	But the whole of human society … the world, the
	whole of civilization, is being stirred up like a Christmas
	pudding. The war’s bound to change the trend of
	all human thought. There must be an entire rearrangement
	of social values.”</p>

	<p>“I’m sorry; but I don’t see it,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>Doggie again wrinkled his brow and looked at her,
	and she returned his glance stonily.</p>

	<p>“You think I’m mulish.”</p>

	<p>She had interpreted Doggie’s thought, but he raised
	a hand in protest.</p>

	<p>“No, no.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, yes. Every man looks at a woman like
	that when he thinks her a mule or an idiot. We
	get to learn it in our cradles. But in spite of your
	<a class="pagenum" id="page264" title="264"> </a>superior wisdom, I know I’m right. After the war
	there won’t be a bit of change, really. A duke will
	be a duke, and a costermonger a costermonger.”</p>

	<p>“These are extreme cases. The duke may remain
	a duke, but he won’t be such a little tin god on wheels.
	He’ll find himself in the position of a democratic
	country gentleman. And the costermonger will rise
	to the political position of an important tradesman.
	But between the two there’ll be any old sort of
	flux.”</p>

	<p>“Did you learn all this horrible, rank socialism
	in France?”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps, but it seems so obvious.”</p>

	<p>“It’s only because you’ve been living among
	Tommies, who’ve got these stupid ideas into their
	heads. If you had been living among your social
	equals——”</p>

	<p>“In Durdlebury?”</p>

	<p>She flashed rebellion. “Yes. In Durdlebury.
	Why not?”</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid, Peggy dear,” he said, with his patient,
	pleasant smile, “you are rather sheltered from the
	war in Durdlebury.”</p>

	<p>She cried out indignantly.</p>

	<p>“Indeed we’re not. The newspapers come to
	Durdlebury, don’t they? And everybody’s doing
	something. We have the war all around us. We’ve
	even succeeded in getting wounded soldiers in the
	Cottage Hospital. Nancy Murdoch is a V.A.D. and
	scrubs floors. Cissy James is driving a Y.M.C.A.
	motor-car in Calais. Jane Brown-Gore is nursing
	in Salonika. We read all their letters. Personally,
	I can’t do much, because mother has crocked up and
	I’ve got to run the Deanery. But I’m slaving from
	morning to night. Only last week I got up a concert
	<a class="pagenum" id="page265" title="265"> </a>for the wounded. Alone I did it—and it takes some
	doing in Durdlebury, now that you’re away and the
	Musical Association has perished of inanition. Old
	Dr. Flint’s no earthly good, since Tom, the eldest
	son—you remember—was killed in Mesopotamia. So
	I did it all, and it was a great success. We netted
	four hundred and seventy pounds. And whenever I
	can get a chance, I go round the hospital and talk
	and read to the men and write their letters, and hear
	of everything. I don’t think you’ve any right to
	say we’re out of touch with the war. In a sort of
	way, I know as much about it as you do.”</p>

	<p>Doggie in some perplexity scratched his head, a
	thing which he would never have done at Durdlebury.
	With humorous intent he asked:</p>

	<p>“Do you know as much as Oliver?”</p>

	<p>“Oliver’s a field officer,” she replied tartly, and
	Doggie felt snubbed. “But I’m sure he agrees with
	everything I say.” She paused and, in a different
	tone, went on: “Don’t you think it’s rather rotten
	to have this piffling argument when I’ve come all
	this long way to see you?”</p>

	<p>“Forgive me, Peggy,” he said penitently; “I
	appreciate your coming more than I can say.”</p>

	<p>She was not appeased. “And yet you don’t give
	me credit for playing the game.”</p>

	<p>“What game?” he asked with a smile.</p>

	<p>“Surely you ought to know.”</p>

	<p>He reached out his hand and took hers. “Am I
	worth it, Peggy?”</p>

	<p>Her lips twitched and tears stood in her eyes.</p>

	<p>“I don’t know what you mean?”</p>

	<p>“Neither do I quite,” he replied simply. “But
	it seems that I’m a Tommy through and through,
	and that I’ll never get Tommy out of my soul.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page266" title="266"> </a>“That’s nothing to be ashamed of,” she declared
	stoutly.</p>

	<p>“Of course not. But it makes one see all sorts
	of things in a different light.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, don’t worry your head about that,” she said,
	with pathetic misunderstanding. “We’ll put you all
	right as soon as we get you back to Durdlebury. I
	suppose you won’t refuse to come this time.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, I’ll come this time,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>So he promised, and the talk drifted on to casual
	lines. She gave him the mild chronicle of the sleepy
	town, described plays which she had seen on her
	rare visits to London, sketched out a programme for
	his all too short visit to the Deanery.</p>

	<p>“And in the meanwhile,” she remarked, “try to
	get these morbid ideas out of your silly old head.”</p>

	<p>Time came for parting. She rose and shook hands.</p>

	<p>“Don’t think I’ve said anything in depreciation of
	Tommies. I understand them thoroughly. They’re
	wonderful fellows. Good-bye, old boy. Get well
	soon.”</p>

	<p>She kissed her hand to him at the door, and was
	gone.</p>

	<p>It was now that Doggie began to hate himself.
	For all the time that Peggy had been running on,
	eager to convince him that his imputation of aloofness
	from the war was undeserved, the voice of one who,
	knowing its splendours and its terrors, had pierced to
	the heart of its mysteries, ran in his ears.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leur gaieté fait peur.</em>”</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XIX"><a class="pagenum" id="page267" title="267"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> X-rays showed the tiniest splinter of bone
	in Doggie’s thigh. The surgeon fished it up
	and the clean wound healed rapidly. The gloomy
	Penworthy’s prognostication had not come true.
	Doggie would not stump about at ease on a wooden
	leg; but in all probability would soon find himself
	back in the firing line—a prospect which brought
	great cheer to Penworthy. Also to Doggie. For,
	in spite of the charm of the pretty hospital, the health-giving
	sea air, the long rest for body and nerves, life
	seemed flat and unprofitable.</p>

	<p>He had written a gay, irreproachable letter to
	Jeanne, to which Jeanne, doubtless thinking it the
	last word of the episode, had not replied. Loyalty
	to Peggy forbade further thought of Jeanne. He
	must henceforward think of Peggy and her sturdy
	faithfulness as hard as he could. But the more he
	thought, the more remote did Peggy seem. Of course
	the publicity of the interview had invested it with a
	certain constraint, knocked out of it any approach
	to sentimentality or romance. They had not even
	kissed. They had spent most of the time arguing
	from different points of view. They had been near
	to quarrelling. It was outrageous of him to criticize
	her; yet how could he help it? The mere fact of
	striving to exalt her was a criticism.</p>

	<p>Indeed they were far apart. Into the sensitive
	soul of Doggie the war in all its meaning had paused.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page268" title="268"> </a>The soul of Peggy had remained untouched. To her,
	in her sheltered corner of England, it was a ghastly
	accident, like a railway collision blocking the traffic
	on her favourite line. For the men of her own class
	who took part in it, it was a brave adventure; for
	the common soldier a sad but patriotic necessity. If
	circumstances had allowed her to go forth into the
	war-world as nurse or canteen helper at a London
	terminus, or motor driver in France, her horizon would
	have broadened. But the contact with realities into
	which her dilettante little war activities brought her
	was too slight to make the deep impression. In her
	heart, as far as she revealed herself to Doggie, she
	resented the war because it interfered with her own
	definitely marked out scheme of existence. The war
	over, she would regard it politely as a thing that had
	never been, and would forthwith set to work upon
	her aforesaid interrupted plan. And towards a comprehension
	of this apparent serenity the perplexed
	mind of Doggie groped with ill-success. All his old
	values had been kicked into higgledy-piggledy confusion.
	All hers remained steadfast.</p>

	<p>So Doggie reflected with some grimness that there
	are rougher roads than those which lead to the trenches.</p>

	<p>A letter from Phineas did not restore equanimity.
	It ran:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“My dear Laddie,—</p>

		<p>“Our unsophisticated friend, Mo, and myself
		are writing this letter together and he bids me begin
		it by saying that he hopes it finds you as it leaves us
		at present, in a muck of dust and perspiration. Where
		we are now I must not tell, for (in the opinion of the
		Censor) you would reveal it to the very Reverend
		the Dean of Durdlebury, who would naturally telegraph
		<a class="pagenum" id="page269" title="269"> </a>the information to the Kaiser. But the Division
		is far, far from the idyllic land of your dreams, and
		there is bloody fighting ahead of us. And though
		the hearts of Mo and me go out to you, laddie, and
		though we miss you sore, yet Mo says he’s blistering
		glad you’re out of it and safe in your perishing bed
		with a Blighty one. And such, in more academic
		phraseology, are the sentiments of your old friend
		Phineas.</p>

		<p>“Ah, laddie! it was a bad day when we marched
		from the old billets; for the word had gone round
		that we weren’t going back. I had taken the liberty
		of telling the lassie ye ken of something about your
		private position and your worldly affairs, of which it
		seems you had left her entirely ignorant. Of course,
		with my native Scottish caution, and my knowledge
		of human nature gained in the academies of prosperity
		and the ragged schools of adversity, I did not touch
		on certain matters of a delicate nature. That is no
		business of mine. If there is discretion in this world
		in which you can trust blindly, it is that of Phineas
		McPhail. I just told her of Denby Hall and your
		fortune, which I fairly accurately computed at a
		couple of million francs. For I thought it was right
		she should know that you weren’t just a scallywag
		private soldier like the rest of us. And I am bound
		to say that the lassie was considerably impressed. In
		further conversation I told her something of your
		early life, and, though not over desirous of blackening
		my character in her bonnie eyes, I let her know what
		kind of an injudicious upbringing you had been compelled
		to undergo. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a été élevé</em>,’ said I, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans</em>——’
		What the blazes was the French for cotton-wool?
		The war has a pernicious effect on one’s memory—I
		sometimes even forget the elementary sensations of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page270" title="270"> </a>inebriety. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans la ouate</em>,’ she said. And I remembered
		the word. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, dans la ouate</em>,’ said I.
		And she looked at me, laddie, or, rather, through me,
		out of her great dark eyes—you mind the way she
		treats your substance as a shadow and looks through
		it at the shadows that to her are substances—and
		she said below her breath—I don’t think she meant
		me to hear it—‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et c’est lui qui a fait cela pour
		moi</em>.’</p>

		<p>“Mo, in his materialistic way, is clamorous that
		I should tell you about the chicken; the which,
		being symbolical, I proceed to do. It was our last
		day. She invited us to lunch in the kitchen and shut
		the door so that none of the hungry varlets of the
		company should stick in their unmannerly noses and
		whine for scraps. And there, laddie, was an omelette
		and cutlets and a chicken and a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fromage à la crême</em>
		such as in the days of my vanity I have never eaten,
		cooked by the old body whose soul you won with a
		pinch of snuff. The poor lassie could scarcely eat;
		but Mo saw that there was nothing left. The bones
		on his plate looked as if a dog had been at them for
		a week. And there was vintage Haut Sauterne which
		ran down one’s throat like scented gold. ‘Man,’
		said I to Mo, ‘if you lap it up like that you’ll be as
		drunk as Noah.’ So he cast a frightened glance at
		mademoiselle and sipped like a young lady at a christening
		party. Then she brings out cherries and plums
		and peaches and opens a half-bottle of champagne
		and fills all our glasses, and Toinette had a glass; and
		she rises in the pale, dignified, Greek tragedy way she
		has, and she makes a wee bit speech. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</em>,’
		she said, ‘perhaps you may wonder why I have invited
		you. But I think you understand. It is the only
		way I had of sharing with Doggie’s friends the fortune
		<a class="pagenum" id="page271" title="271"> </a>that he had so heroically brought me. It is but a little
		tribute of my gratitude to Doggie. You are his friends
		and I wish well that you would be mine—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très franchement,
		très loyalement</em>.’ She put out her hand and we
		shook it. And old Mo said, ‘Miss, I’d go to hell
		for you!’ Whereupon the little red spot you may
		have seen for yourself, came into her pale cheek,
		and a soft look like a flitting moonbeam crept into
		her eyes. Laddie, if I’m waxing too poetical, just
		consider that Mademoiselle Jeanne Bossière is not the
		ordinary woman the British private soldier is in the
		habit of consorting with. Then she took up her
		glass. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vais porter un toast—Vive l’Angleterre!</em>’
		And although a Scotsman, I drank it as if it applied
		to me. And then she cried, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France!</em>’ And
		old Toinette cried, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France!</em>’</p>

		<p>“And they looked transfigured, and I fairly itched
		to sing the Marseillaise, though I knew I couldn’t.
		Then she chinked glasses with us.</p>

		<p>“‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne chance, mes amis!</em>’</p>

		<p>“And then she made a sign to the auld wife, who
		added the few remaining drops to our glasses. ‘To
		Doggie!’ said mademoiselle. We drank the toast,
		laddie. Old Mo began in his cracked voice, ‘For
		he’s a jolly good fellow.’ I kicked him and told him
		to shut up. But mademoiselle said:</p>

		<p>“‘I’ve heard of that. It is a ceremony. I like
		it. Continue.’</p>

		<p>“So Mo and I held up our glasses and, in indifferent
		song, proclaimed you what the Army, developing
		certain rudimentary germs, has made you, and mademoiselle
		too held up her glass and threw back her head
		and joined us in the hip, hip, hoorays. It would
		have done your heart good, laddie, to have been there
		to see. But we did you proud.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page272" title="272"> </a>“When we emerged from the festival, the prettiest
		which, in the course of a variegated career, I have
		ever attended, Mo says:</p>

		<p>“‘If I hadn’t a gel at home——’</p>

		<p>“‘If you hadn’t got a girl at home,’ said I, ‘you’d
		be the next damnedest fool in the army to Phineas
		McPhail!’</p>

		<p>“We marched out just before dusk, and there she
		was by the front door; and though she stood proud
		and upright, and smiled with her lips and blew us
		kisses with both hands, to which the boys all responded
		with a cheer, there were tears streaming down her
		cheeks—and the tears, laddie, were not for Mo, or
		me, or any one of us ugly beggars that passed her by.</p>

		<p>“I also have good news for you, in that I hear
		from the thunderous, though excellent, Sergeant
		Ballinghall, there is a probability that when you rejoin,
		the C.O. will be afflicted with a grievous lapse of
		memory and that he will be persuaded that you
		received your wound during the attack on the wiring
		party.</p>

		<p>“As I said before, laddie, we’re all like the Scots
		wha’ hae wi’ Wallace bled and are going to our gory
		bed or to victory. Possibly both. But I will remain
		steadfast to my philosophy, and if I am condemned to
		the said sanguinolent couch, I will do my best to derive
		from it the utmost enjoyment possible. All kinds of
		poets and such-like lusty loons have shed their last
		drop of ink in the effort to describe the pleasures of
		life—but it will be reserved for the disembodied spirit
		of Phineas McPhail to write the great Philosophic
		poem of the world’s history, which will be entitled
		‘The Pleasures of Death.’ While you’re doing
		nothing, laddie, you might bestir yourself and find
		an enlightened publisher who would be willing to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page273" title="273"> </a>give me an ante-mortem advance, in respect of royalties
		accruing to my ghost.</p>

		<p>“Mo, to whom I have read the last paragraph, says
		he always knew that eddication affected the brain.
		With which incontrovertible proposition and our joint
		love, I now conclude this epistle.</p>

		<p class="signature">“Yours, <span class="name">Phineas</span>.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>“Of all the blazing imbeciles!” Doggie cried
	aloud. Why the unprintable unprintableness couldn’t
	Phineas mind his own business? Why had he given
	his silly accident of fortune away in this childish
	manner? Why had he told Jeanne of his cotton-wool
	upbringing? His feet, even that of his wounded
	leg, tingled to kick Phineas. Of course Jeanne,
	knowing him now to be such a gilded ass, would have
	nothing more to do with him. It explained her letter.
	He damned Phineas to all eternity, in terms compared
	with which the curse of Saint Ernulphus enunciated
	by the late Mr. Shandy was a fantastic benediction.
	“If I had a dog,” quoth my Uncle Toby, “I would
	not curse him so.” But if Uncle Toby had heard
	Doggie of the Twentieth Century Armies who also
	swore terribly in Flanders, for dog he would have
	substituted rattlesnake or German officer.</p>

	<p>Yet such is the quiddity of the English Tommy,
	that through this devastating anathema ran a streak
	of love which at the end turned the whole thing into
	forlorn derision. And as soon as he could laugh, he
	saw things in a clear light. Both of his two friends
	were, in their respective ways, in love with his wonderful
	Jeanne. Both of them were steel-true to him.
	It was just part of their loyalty to foment this impossible
	romance between Jeanne and himself. If the three
	of them were now at Frélus, the two idiots would
	<a class="pagenum" id="page274" title="274"> </a>be playing gooseberry with the smirking conscientiousness
	of a pair of schoolgirls. So Doggie forgave the
	indiscretion. After all, what did it matter?</p>

	<p>It mattered, however, to this extent, that he read
	the letter over and over again until he knew it by
	heart and could picture to himself every phase of the
	banquet and every fleeting look on Jeanne’s face.</p>

	<p>“All this,” he declared at last, “is utterly ridiculous.”
	And he tore up Phineas’s letter and, during
	his convalescence, devoted himself to the study of
	European politics, a subject which he had scandalously
	neglected during his elegantly leisured youth.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The day of his discharge came in due course. A
	suit of khaki took the place of the hospital blue. He
	received his papers, the seven days’ sick furlough and
	his railway warrant, shook hands with nurses and
	comrades and sped to Durdlebury in the third-class
	carriage of the Tommy.</p>

	<p>Peggy, in the two-seater, was waiting for him in
	the station yard. He exchanged greetings from afar,
	grinned, waved a hand and jumped in beside her.</p>

	<p>“How jolly of you to meet me!”</p>

	<p>“Where’s your luggage?”</p>

	<p>“Luggage?”</p>

	<p>It seemed to be a new word. He had not heard it
	for many months. He laughed.</p>

	<p>“Haven’t got any, thank God! If you knew
	what it was to hunch a horrible canvas sausage of
	kit about, you’d appreciate feeling free.”</p>

	<p>“It’s a mercy you’ve got Peddle,” said Peggy.
	“He has been at the Deanery fixing things up for
	you for the last two days.”</p>

	<p>“I wonder if I shall be able to live up to Peddle,”
	said Doggie.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page275" title="275"> </a>“Who’s going to start the car?” she asked.</p>

	<p>“Oh, lord!” he cried, and bolted out and turned
	the crank. “I’m awfully sorry,” he added, when,
	the engine running, he resumed his place. “I had
	forgotten all about these pretty things. Out there a
	car is a sacred chariot set apart for gods in brass hats,
	and the ordinary Tommy looks on them with awe
	and reverence.”</p>

	<p>“Can’t you forget you’re a Tommy for a few
	days?” she said, as soon as the car had cleared the
	station gates and was safely under way.</p>

	<p>He noted a touch of irritation. “All right, Peggy
	dear,” said he. “I’ll do what I can.”</p>

	<p>“Oliver’s here, with his man Chipmunk,” she
	remarked, her eyes on the road.</p>

	<p>“Oliver? On leave again? How has he managed
	it?”</p>

	<p>“You’d better ask him,” she replied tartly. “All
	I know is that he turned up yesterday, and he’s staying
	with us. That’s why I don’t want you to ram
	the fact of your being a Tommy down everybody’s
	throat.”</p>

	<p>He laughed at the queer little social problem that
	seemed to be worrying her. “I think you’ll find
	blood is thicker than military etiquette. After all,
	Oliver’s my first cousin. If he can’t get on with
	me, he can get out.” To change the conversation,
	he added after a pause: “The little car’s running
	splendidly.”</p>

	<p>They swept through the familiar old-world streets,
	which, now that the early frenzy of mobilizing Territorials
	and training of new armies was over, had
	resumed more or less their pre-war appearance. The
	sleepy meadows by the river, once ground into black
	slush by guns and ammunition waggons and horses,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page276" title="276"> </a>were now green again and idle, and the troops once
	billeted on the citizens had marched heaven knows
	whither—many to heaven itself—or whatever Paradise
	is reserved for the great-hearted English fighting man
	who has given his life for England. Only here and
	there a stray soldier on leave, or one of the convalescents
	from the cottage hospital, struck an incongruous note
	of war. They drew up at the door of the Deanery
	under the shadow of the great cathedral.</p>

	<p>“Thank God that is out of reach of the Boche,”
	said Doggie, regarding it with a new sense of its
	beauty and spiritual significance. “To think of it
	like Rheims or Arras—I’ve seen Arras—seen a shell
	burst among the still standing ruins. Oh, Peggy”—he
	gripped her arm—“you dear people haven’t the
	remotest conception of what it all is—what France
	has suffered. Imagine this mass of wonder all one
	horrible stone pie, without a trace of what it once
	had been.”</p>

	<p>“I suppose we’re jolly lucky,” she replied.</p>

	<p>The door was opened by the old butler, who had
	been on the alert for the arrival.</p>

	<p>“You run in,” said Peggy, “I’ll take the car round
	to the yard.”</p>

	<p>So Doggie, with a smile and a word of greeting,
	entered the Deanery. His uncle appeared in the hall,
	florid, white-haired, benevolent, and extended both
	hands to the home-come warrior.</p>

	<p>“My dear boy, how glad I am to see you. Welcome
	back. And how’s the wound? We’ve thought
	night and day of you. If I could have spared the
	time, I should have run up north, but I’ve not a
	minute to call my own. We’re doing our share of
	war work here, my boy. Come into the drawing-room.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page277" title="277"> </a>He put his hand affectionately on Doggie’s arm and,
	opening the drawing-room door, pushed him in and
	stood, in his kind, courtly way, until the young man
	had passed the threshold. Mrs. Conover, feeble from
	illness, rose and kissed him, and gave him much the
	same greeting as her husband. Then a tall, lean
	figure in uniform, who had remained in the background
	by the fireplace, advanced with outstretched hand.</p>

	<p>“Hello, old chap!”</p>

	<p>Doggie took the hand in an honest grip.</p>

	<p>“Hello, Oliver!”</p>

	<p>“How goes it?”</p>

	<p>“Splendid,” said Doggie. “You all right?”</p>

	<p>“Top-hole,” said Oliver. He clapped his cousin
	on the shoulder. “My hat! you do look fit.” He
	turned to the Dean. “Uncle Edward, isn’t he a
	hundred times the man he was?”</p>

	<p>“I told you, my boy, you would see a difference,”
	said the Dean.</p>

	<p>Peggy ran in, having delivered the two-seater to
	the care of myrmidons.</p>

	<p>“Now that the affecting meeting is over, let us
	have tea. Oliver, ring the bell.”</p>

	<p>The tea came. It appeared to Doggie, handing
	round the three-tiered silver cake-stand, that he had
	returned to some forgotten former incarnation. The
	delicate china cup in his hand seemed too frail for the
	material usages of life and he feared lest he should
	break it with rough handling. Old habit, however,
	prevailed, and no one noticed his sense of awkwardness.
	The talk lay chiefly between Oliver and himself.
	They exchanged experiences as to dates and localities.
	They bandied about the names of places which will
	be inscribed in letters of blood in history for all time,
	as though they were popular golf-courses. Both had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page278" title="278"> </a>known Ypres and Plug Street, and the famous wall
	at Arras, where the British and German trenches
	were but five yards apart. Oliver’s division had gone
	down to the Somme in July for the great push.</p>

	<p>“I ought to be there now,” said Oliver. “I feel
	a hulking slacker and fraud, being home on sick leave.
	But the M.O. said I had just escaped shell-shock by
	the skin of my nerves, and they packed me home for
	a fortnight to rest up—while the regiment, what there’s
	left of it, went into reserve.”</p>

	<p>“Did you get badly cut up?” asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Rather. We broke through all right. Then
	machine guns which we had overlooked got us in
	the back.”</p>

	<p>“My lot’s down there now,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You’re well out of it, old chap,” laughed Oliver.</p>

	<p>For the first time in his life Doggie began really to
	like Oliver. The old-time swashbuckling swagger
	had gone—the swagger of one who would say: “I
	am the only live man in this comatose crowd. I
	am the dare-devil buccaneer who defies the thunder
	and sleeps on boards while the rest of you are lying
	soft in feather-beds.” His direct, cavalier way he
	still retained; but the army, with the omnipotent
	might of its inherited traditions, had moulded him
	to its pattern; even as it had moulded Doggie. And
	Doggie, who had learned many of the lessons in human
	psychology which the army teaches, knew that Oliver’s
	genial, familiar talk was not all due to his appreciation
	of their social equality in the bosom of their own
	family, but that he would have treated much the
	same any Tommy into whose companionship he had
	been casually thrown. The Tommy would have
	said “sir” very scrupulously, which on Doggie’s part
	would have been an idiotic thing to do; but they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page279" title="279"> </a>would have got on famously together, bound by the
	freemasonry of fighting men who had cursed the same
	foe for the same reasons. So Oliver stood out before
	Doggie’s eyes in a new light, that of the typical officer
	trusted and beloved by his men, and his heart went
	out to him.</p>

	<p>“I’ve brought Chipmunk over,” said Oliver.
	“You remember the freak? The poor devil hasn’t
	had a day’s leave for a couple of years. Didn’t want
	it. Why should he go and waste money in a country
	where he didn’t know a human being? But this
	time I’ve fixed it up for him and his leave is coterminous
	with mine. He has been my servant all
	through. If they took him away from me, he’d be
	quite capable of strangling the C.O. He’s a funny
	beggar.”</p>

	<p>“And what kind of a soldier?” the Dean asked
	politely.</p>

	<p>“There’s not a finer one in all the armies of the
	earth,” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>After much further talk the dressing-gong boomed
	softly through the house.</p>

	<p>“You’ve got the green room, Marmaduke,” said
	Peggy. “The one with the Chippendale stuff you
	used to covet so much.”</p>

	<p>“I haven’t got much to change into,” laughed
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You’ll find Peddle up there waiting for you,”
	she replied.</p>

	<p>And when Doggie entered the green room there
	he found Peddle, who welcomed him with tears of
	joy and a display of all the finikin luxuries of the toilet
	and adornment which he had left behind at Denby
	Hall. There were pots of pomade and face-cream,
	and nail-polish; bottles of hair-wash and tooth-wash;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page280" title="280"> </a>little boxes and brushes for the moustache, half a dozen
	gleaming razors, an array of brushes and combs and
	manicure-set in tortoise-shell with his crest in silver,
	bottles of scent with spray attachments; the onyx
	bowl of bath salts beside the hip-bath ready to be filled
	from the ewers of hot and cold water—the Deanery,
	old-fashioned house, had but one family bath-room;
	the deep purple silk dressing-gown over the foot-rail
	of the bed, the silk pyjamas in a lighter shade spread
	out over the pillow, the silk underwear and soft-fronted
	shirt fitted with his ruby and diamond sleeve-links,
	hung up before the fire to air; the dinner jacket suit
	laid out on the glass-topped Chippendale table, with
	black tie and delicate handkerchief; the silk socks
	carefully tucked inside out, the glossy pumps with
	the silver shoe-horn laid across them.</p>

	<p>“My God! Peddle,” cried Doggie, scratching his
	closely cropped head. “What the devil’s all this?”</p>

	<p>Peddle, grey, bent, uncomprehending, regarded him
	blankly.</p>

	<p>“All what, sir?”</p>

	<p>“I only want to wash my hands,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“But aren’t you going to dress for dinner, sir?”</p>

	<p>“A private soldier’s not allowed to wear mufti,
	Peddle. They’d dock me of a week’s pay if they
	found out.”</p>

	<p>“Who’s to find out, sir?”</p>

	<p>“There’s Mr. Oliver—he’s a Major.”</p>

	<p>“Lord, Mr. Marmaduke, I don’t think he’d mind.
	Miss Peggy gave me my orders, sir, and I think you
	can leave things to her.”</p>

	<p>“All right, Peddle,” he laughed. “If it’s Miss
	Peggy’s decree, I’ll change. I’ve got all I want.”</p>

	<p>“Are you sure you can manage, sir?” Peddle
	asked anxiously, for time was when Doggie couldn’t
	<a class="pagenum" id="page281" title="281"> </a>stick his legs into his trousers unless Peddle held them
	out for him.</p>

	<p>“Quite,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“It seems rather roughing it here, Mr. Marmaduke,
	after what you’ve been accustomed to at the Hall.”</p>

	<p>“That’s so,” said Doggie. “And it’s martyrdom
	compared with what it is in the trenches. There we
	always have a major-general to lace up our boots, and
	a field-marshal’s always hovering round to light our
	cigarettes.”</p>

	<p>Peddle, who had never known him to jest, or his
	father before him, went out in a muddled frame of
	mind, leaving Doggie to struggle into his dress trousers
	as best he might.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XX"><a class="pagenum" id="page282" title="282"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XX</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">When</span> Doggie, in dinner suit, went downstairs,
	he found Peggy alone in the drawing-room.
	She gave him the kiss of one accustomed to
	kiss him from childhood, and sat down again on the
	fender-stool.</p>

	<p>“Now you look more like a Christian gentleman,”
	she laughed. “Confess. It’s much more comfortable
	than your wretched private’s uniform.”</p>

	<p>“I’m not quite so sure,” he said, somewhat ruefully,
	indicating his dinner jacket tightly constricted beneath
	the arms. “Already I’ve had to slit my waistcoat
	down the back. Poor old Peddle will have an apoplectic
	fit when he sees it. I’ve grown a bit since
	these elegant rags were made for me.”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut souffrir pour être beau</em>,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“If my being <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau</em> pleases you, Peggy, I’ll suffer
	gladly. I’ve been in tighter places.” He threw
	himself down in the corner of the sofa and joggled
	up and down like a child. “After all,” he said,
	“it’s jolly to sit on something squashy again, and to
	see a pretty girl in a pretty frock.”</p>

	<p>“I’m glad you like this frock.”</p>

	<p>“New?”</p>

	<p>She nodded. “Dad said it was too much of a
	Vanity Fair of a vanity for war-time. You don’t
	think so, do you?”</p>

	<p>“It’s charming,” said Doggie. “A treat for tired
	eyes.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page283" title="283"> </a>“That’s just what I told dad. What’s the good
	of women dressing in sacks tied round the middle with
	a bit of string? When men come home from the
	Front they want to see their womenfolk looking pretty
	and dainty. That’s what they’ve come over for.
	It’s part of the cure. It’s the first time you’ve been
	a real dear, Marmaduke. ‘A treat for tired eyes.’
	I’ll rub it into dad hard.”</p>

	<p>Oliver came in—in khaki. Doggie jumped up
	and pointed to him.</p>

	<p>“Look here, Peggy. It’s the guard-room for me.”</p>

	<p>Oliver laughed. “Where the dinner kit I bought
	when I came home is now, God only can tell.” He
	turned to Peggy. “I did change, you know.”</p>

	<p>“That’s the pull of being a beastly Major,” said
	Doggie. “They have heaps of suits. On the march,
	there are motor-lorries full of them. It’s the scandal
	of the army. The wretched Tommy has but one
	suit to his name. That’s why, sir, I’ve taken the
	liberty of appearing before you in outgrown mufti.”</p>

	<p>“All right, my man,” said Oliver. “We’ll hush
	it up and say no more about it.”</p>

	<p>Then the Dean and Mrs. Conover entered and
	soon they went in to dinner. It was for Doggie the
	most pleasant of meals. He had the superbly
	healthy man’s whole-hearted or whole-stomached
	appreciation of unaccustomed good food and drink:
	so much so, that when the Dean, after agonies of
	thwarted mastication, said gently to his wife: “My
	dear, don’t you think you might speak a word in
	season to Peck”—Peck being the butcher—“and
	forbid him, under the Defence of the Realm Act, if
	you like, to deliver to us in the evening as lamb that
	which was in the morning a lusty sheep?” he stared
	at the good old man as though he were Vitellius in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page284" title="284"> </a>person. Tough? It was like milk-fatted baby. He
	was already devouring, like Oliver, his second helping.
	Then the Dean, pledging him and Oliver in
	champagne, apologized: “I’m sorry, my dear boys,
	the 1904 has run out and there’s no more to be got.
	But the 1906, though not having the quality, is
	quite drinkable.”</p>

	<p>Drinkable! It was laughing, dancing joy that
	went down his throat.</p>

	<p>So much for gross delights. There were others—finer.
	The charm to the eye of the table with its
	exquisite napery and china and glass and silver and
	flowers. The almost intoxicating atmosphere of peace
	and gentle living. The full, loving welcome shining
	from the eyes of the kind old Dean, his uncle by
	marriage, and of the faded, delicate lady, his own flesh
	and blood, his mother’s sister. And Peggy, pretty,
	flushed, bright-eyed, radiant in her new dress. And
	there was Oliver….</p>

	<p>Most of all he appreciated Oliver’s comrade-like
	attitude. It was a recognition of him as a man and
	a soldier. In the course of dinner talk Oliver said:</p>

	<p>“J.M.T. and I have looked Death in the face many
	a time—and really he’s a poor raw-head and bloody-bones
	sort of Bogey; don’t you think so, old chap?”</p>

	<p>“It all depends on whether you’ve got a funk-hole
	handy,” he replied.</p>

	<p>But that was mere lightness of speech. Oliver’s
	inclusion of him in his remark shook him to the depths
	of his sensitive nature. The man who despises the
	petty feelings and frailties of mankind is doomed to
	remain in awful ignorance of that which there is of
	beauty and pathos in the lives of his fellow-creatures.
	After all, what did it matter what Oliver thought of
	him? Who was Oliver? His cousin—accident of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page285" title="285"> </a>birth—the black sheep of the family; now a major
	in a different regiment and a different division. What
	was Oliver to him or he to Oliver? He had “made
	good” in the eyes of one whose judgment had been
	forged keen and absolute by heroic sorrows. What
	did anyone else matter? But to Doggie the supreme
	joy of the evening was the knowledge that he had
	made good in the eyes of Oliver. Oliver wore on
	his tunic the white mauve and white ribbon of the
	Military Cross. Honour where honour was due.
	But he, Doggie, had been wounded (no matter how)
	and Oliver frankly put them both on the same plane
	of achievement, thus wiping away, with generous hand,
	all hated memories of the past.</p>

	<p>When the ladies had left the room, history repeated
	itself, in that the Dean was called away on business
	and the cousins were left alone together over their
	wine. Said Doggie:</p>

	<p>“Do you remember the last time we sat at this
	table?”</p>

	<p>“Perfectly,” replied Oliver, holding up a glass of
	the old Deanery port to the light. “You were
	horrified at my attempting to clean out my pipe with
	a dessert knife.”</p>

	<p>Doggie laughed. “After all, it was a filthy thing
	to do.”</p>

	<p>“I quite agree with you. Since then I’ve learned
	manners.”</p>

	<p>“You also made me squirm at the idea of scooping
	out Boches’ insides with bayonets.”</p>

	<p>“And you’ve learned not to squirm, so we’re quits.”</p>

	<p>“You thought me a rotten ass in those days, didn’t
	you?”</p>

	<p>Oliver looked at him squarely.</p>

	<p>“I don’t think it would hurt you now if I said
	<a class="pagenum" id="page286" title="286"> </a>that I did.” He laughed, stretched himself on his
	chair, thrusting both hands into his trouser pockets.
	“In many ways, it’s a jolly good old war, you know—for
	those that pull through. It has taught us both
	a lot, Marmaduke.”</p>

	<p>Doggie wrinkled his forehead in his half-humorous
	way.</p>

	<p>“I wish it would teach people not to call me by
	that silly name.”</p>

	<p>“I have always abominated it, as you may have
	observed,” said Oliver. “But in our present polite
	relations, old chap, what else is there?”</p>

	<p>“You ought to know——”</p>

	<p>Oliver stared at him. “You don’t mean——?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

	<p>“But you used to loathe it and I went on calling
	you ‘Doggie’ because I knew you loathed it. I
	never dreamed of using it now.”</p>

	<p>“I can’t help it,” replied Doggie. “The name
	got into the army and has stuck to me right through,
	and now those I love and trust most in the world,
	and who love and trust me, call me ‘Doggie,’ and I
	don’t seem to be able to answer to any other name.
	So, although I’m only a Tommy and you’re a devil
	of a swell of a second-in-command, yet if you want to
	be friendly—well——”</p>

	<p>Oliver leaned forward quickly. “Of course I
	want to be friends, Doggie, old chap. As for major
	and private—when you pass me in the street you’ve
	dam well got to salute me, and that’s all there is to
	it—but otherwise it’s all rot. And now we’ve got
	to the heart-to-heart stage, don’t you think you’re a
	bit of a fool?”</p>

	<p>“I know it,” said Doggie cheerfully. “The army
	has drummed that into me, at any rate.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page287" title="287"> </a>“I mean in staying in the ranks. Why don’t
	you apply for the Cadet Corps and so get through to
	a commission again?”</p>

	<p>Doggie’s brow grew dark. “I had all that out
	with Peggy long ago—when things were perhaps
	somewhat different with me. I was sore all over.
	I dare say you can understand. But now there are
	other reasons, much stronger reasons. The only
	real happiness I’ve had in my life has been as a Tommy.
	I’m not talking through my hat. The only real
	friends I’ve ever made in my life are Tommies. I’ve
	found real things as a Tommy and I’m not going to
	start all over again to find them in another capacity.”</p>

	<p>“You wouldn’t have to start all over again,”
	Oliver objected.</p>

	<p>“Oh yes, I should. Don’t run away with the idea
	that I’ve been turned by a miracle into a brawny
	hero. I’m not anything of the sort. To have to
	lead men into action would be a holy terror. The old
	dread of seeking new paths still acts, you see. I’m
	the same Doggie that wouldn’t go out to Huaheine
	with you. Only now I’m a private and I’m used to
	it. I love it and I’m not going to change to the end
	of the whole gory business. Of course Peggy doesn’t
	like it,” he added after a sip of wine. “But I can’t
	help that. It’s a matter of temperament and conscience—in
	a way, a matter of honour.”</p>

	<p>“What has honour got to do with it?” asked Oliver.</p>

	<p>“I’ll try to explain. It’s somehow this way.
	When I came to my senses after being chucked for
	incompetence—that was the worst hell I ever went
	through in my life—and I enlisted, I swore that I
	would stick it as a Tommy without anybody’s sympathy,
	least of all that of the folks here. And then
	I swore I’d make good to myself as a Tommy. I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page288" title="288"> </a>was just beginning to feel happier when that infernal
	Boche sniper knocked me out for a time. So, Peggy
	or no Peggy, I’m going through with it. I suppose
	I’m telling you all this because I should like you to
	know.”</p>

	<p>He passed his hand, in the familiar gesture, from back
	to front of his short-cropped hair. Oliver smiled
	at the reminiscence of the old disturbed Doggie;
	but he said very gravely:</p>

	<p>“I’m glad you’ve told me, old man. I appreciate
	it very much. I’ve been through the ranks myself
	and know what it is—the bad and the good. Many a
	man has found his soul that way——”</p>

	<p>“Good God!” cried Doggie, starting to his feet.
	“Do you say that too?”</p>

	<p>“Who else said it?”</p>

	<p>The quick question caused the blood to rush to
	Doggie’s face. Oliver’s keen, half-mocking gaze
	held him. He cursed himself for an impulsive idiot.
	The true answer to the question would be a confession
	of Jeanne. The scene in the kitchen of Frélus swam
	before his eyes. He dropped into his chair again
	with a laugh.</p>

	<p>“Oh, some one out there—in another heart-to-heart
	talk. As a matter of fact, I think I said it
	myself. It’s odd you should have used the same words.
	Anyhow, you’re the only other person who has hit on
	the truth as far as I’m concerned. Finding one’s soul
	is a bit high-falutin—but that’s about the size of it.”</p>

	<p>“Peggy hasn’t hit on the truth, then?” Oliver
	asked, with curious earnestness, the shade of mockery
	gone.</p>

	<p>“The war has scarcely touched her yet, you see,”
	said Doggie. He rose, shrinking from discussion.
	“Shall we go in?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page289" title="289"> </a>In the drawing-room they played bridge till the
	ladies’ bedtime. The Dean coming in, played the
	last rubber.</p>

	<p>“I hope you’ll be able to sleep in a common or
	garden bed, Marmaduke,” said Peggy, and kissed him
	a perfunctory good night.</p>

	<p>“I have heard,” remarked the Dean, “that it takes
	quite a time to grow accustomed to the little amenities
	of civilization.”</p>

	<p>“That’s quite true, Uncle Edward,” laughed
	Doggie. “I’m terrified at the thought of the silk
	pyjamas Peddle has prescribed for me.”</p>

	<p>“Why?” Peggy asked bluntly.</p>

	<p>Oliver interposed laughing, his hand on Doggie’s
	shoulder.</p>

	<p>“Tommy’s accustomed to go to bed in his day-shirt.”</p>

	<p>“How perfectly disgusting!” cried Peggy, and
	swept from the room.</p>

	<p>Oliver dropped his hand and looked somewhat
	abashed.</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid I’ve been and gone and done it. I’m
	sorry. I’m still a barbarian South Sea Islander.”</p>

	<p>“I wish I were a young man,” said the Dean,
	moving from the door and inviting them to sit, “and
	could take part in these strange hardships. This
	question of night attire, for instance, has never struck
	me before. The whole thing is of amazing interest.
	Ah! what it is to be old! If I were young, I should
	be with you, cloth or no cloth, in the trenches. I
	hope both of you know that I vehemently dissent from
	those bishops who prohibit the younger clergy from
	taking their place in the fighting line. If God’s
	archangels and angels themselves took up the sword
	against the Powers of Darkness, surely a stalwart
	<a class="pagenum" id="page290" title="290"> </a>young curate of the Church of England would find
	his vocation in warring with rifle and bayonet against
	the proclaimed enemies of God and mankind?”</p>

	<p>“The influence of the twenty thousand or so of
	priests fighting in the French Army is said to be
	enormous,” Oliver remarked.</p>

	<p>The Dean sighed. “I’m afraid we’re losing a
	big chance.”</p>

	<p>“Why don’t you take up the Fiery Cross, Uncle
	Edward, and run a new Crusade?”</p>

	<p>The Dean sighed. Five-and-thirty years ago,
	when he had set all Durdlebury by the ears, he might
	have preached glorious heresy and heroic schism;
	but now the immutability of the great grey fabric
	had become part of his being.</p>

	<p>“I’ve done my best, my boy,” he replied, “with the
	result that I am held in high disfavour.”</p>

	<p>“But that doesn’t matter a little bit.”</p>

	<p>“Not a little bit,” said the Dean. “A man can
	only do his duty according to the dictates of his conscience.
	I have publicly deplored the attitude of the
	Church of England. I have written to <cite>The Times</cite>.
	I have published a pamphlet—I sent you each a copy—which
	has brought a hornets’ nest about my ears.
	I have warned those in high places that what they are
	doing is not in the best interests of the Church. But
	they won’t listen.”</p>

	<p>Oliver lit a pipe. “I’m afraid, Uncle Edward,”
	he said, “that though I come of a clerical family, I
	know no more of religion than a Hun bishop; but
	it has always struck me that the Church’s job is to
	look after the people, whereas, as far as I can make
	out, the Church is now squealing because the people
	won’t look after the Church.”</p>

	<p>The Dean rose. “I won’t go as far as that,” said
	<a class="pagenum" id="page291" title="291"> </a>he with a smile. “But there is, I fear, some justification
	for such a criticism from the laity. As soon
	as the war began the Church should have gathered the
	people together and said, ‘Onward, Christian soldiers.
	Go and fight like—er——’”</p>

	<p>“Like hell,” suggested Oliver, greatly daring.</p>

	<p>“Or words to that effect,” smiled the old Dean.
	He looked at his watch. “Dear, dear! past eleven.
	I wish I could sit up talking to you boys. But I
	start my day’s work at eight o’clock. If you want
	anything, you’ve only got to ring. Good night.
	It is one of the proudest days of my life to have you
	both here together.”</p>

	<p>His courtly charm seemed to linger in the room
	after he had left.</p>

	<p>“He’s a dear old chap,” said Oliver.</p>

	<p>“One of the best,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“It’s rather pathetic,” said Oliver. “In his heart
	he would like to play the devil with the bishops and
	kick every able-bodied parson into the trenches—and
	there are thousands of them that don’t need any
	kicking and, on the contrary, have been kicked back;
	but he has become half-petrified in the atmosphere of
	this place. It’s lovely to come to as a sort of funk-hole
	of peace—but my holy aunt!—What the blazes
	are you laughing at?”</p>

	<p>“I’m only thinking of a beast of a boy here who
	used to say that,” replied Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Oh!” said Oliver, and he grinned. “Anyway,
	I was only going to remark that if I thought I was
	going to spend the rest of my life here, I’d paint
	the town vermilion for a week and then cut my
	throat.”</p>

	<p>“I quite agree with you,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“What are you going to do when the war’s over?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page292" title="292"> </a>“Who knows what he’s going to do? What are
	you going to do? Fly back to your little Robinson
	Crusoe Durdlebury of a Pacific Island? I don’t
	think so.”</p>

	<p>Oliver stuck his pipe on the mantelpiece and his
	hands on his hips and made a stride towards Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Damn you, Doggie! Damn you to little bits!
	How the Hades did you guess what I’ve scarcely
	told myself, much less another human being?”</p>

	<p>“You yourself said it was a good old war and it has
	taught us a lot of things.”</p>

	<p>“It has,” said Oliver. “But I never expected to
	hear Huaheine called Durdlebury by you, Doggie.
	Oh, Lord! I must have another drink. Where’s
	your glass? Say when?”</p>

	<p>They parted for the night the best of friends.</p>

	<p>Doggie, in spite of the silk pyjamas and the soft bed
	and the blazing fire in his room—he stripped back the
	light-excluding curtains forgetful of Defence of the
	Realm Acts, and opened all the windows wide, to the
	horror of Peddle in the morning—slept like an unperturbed
	dormouse. When Peddle woke him, he lay
	drowsily while the old butler filled his bath and fiddled
	about with drawers. At last aroused, he cried out:</p>

	<p>“What the dickens are you doing?”</p>

	<p>Peddle turned with an injured air. “I am matching
	your ties and socks for your bottle-green suit, sir.”</p>

	<p>Doggie leaped out of bed. “You dear old idiot, I
	can’t go about the streets in bottle-green suits. I’ve
	got to wear my uniform.” He looked around the
	room. “Where the devil is it?”</p>

	<p>Peddle’s injured air deepened almost into resentment.</p>

	<p>“Where the devil——!” Never had Mr. Marmaduke,
	or his father, the Canon, used such language.
	He drew himself up.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page293" title="293"> </a>“I have given orders, sir, for the uniform suit you
	wore yesterday to be sent to the cleaners.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, hell!” said Doggie. And Peddle, unaccustomed
	to the vernacular of the British Army,
	paled with horror. “Oh, hell!” said Doggie.
	“Look here, Peddle, just you get on a bicycle, or a
	motor-car, or an express train at once and retrieve
	that uniform. Don’t you understand? I’m a private
	soldier. I’ve got to wear uniform all the time, and
	I’ll have to stay in this beastly bed until you get it
	for me.”</p>

	<p>Peddle fled. The picture that he left on Doggie’s
	mind was that of the faithful steward with dismayed,
	uplifted hands, retiring from the room in one of the
	great scenes of Hogarth’s “Rake’s Progress.” The
	similitude made him laugh—for Doggie always had
	a saving sense of humour—but he was very angry
	with Peddle, while he stamped around the room in his
	silk pyjamas. What the deuce was he going to do?
	Even if he committed the military crime (and there
	was a far more serious crime already against him)
	of appearing in public in mufti, did that old ass think
	he was going to swagger about Durdlebury in bottle-green
	suits, as though he were ashamed of the King’s
	uniform? He dipped his shaving-brush into the
	hot water. Then he threw it, anyhow, across the
	room. Instead of shaving, he would be gloating
	over the idea of cutting that old fool, Peddle’s, throat,
	and therefore would slash his own face to bits.</p>

	<p>Things, however, were not done at lightning speed
	in the Deanery of Durdlebury. The first steps had
	not even been taken to send the uniform to the cleaners,
	and soon Peddle reappeared carrying it over his arm
	and the heavy pair of munition boots in his hand.</p>

	<p>“These too, sir?” he asked, exhibiting the latter
	<a class="pagenum" id="page294" title="294"> </a>resignedly and casting a sad glance at the neat pair
	of brown shoes exquisitely polished and beautifully
	treed which he had put out for his master’s wear.</p>

	<p>“These too,” said Doggie. “And where’s my
	grey flannel shirt?”</p>

	<p>This time Peddle triumphed. “I’ve given that
	away, sir, to the gardener’s boy.”</p>

	<p>“Well, you can just go and buy me half a dozen
	more like it,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>He dismissed the old man, dressed and went downstairs.
	The Dean had breakfasted at seven. Peggy
	and Oliver were not yet down for the nine o’clock
	meal. Doggie strolled about the garden and sauntered
	round to the stable-yard. There he encountered
	Chipmunk in his shirt-sleeves, sitting on a packing
	case and polishing Oliver’s leggings. He raised an
	ugly, clean-shaven mug and scowled beneath his
	bushy eyebrows at the new-comer.</p>

	<p>“Morning, mate!” said Doggie pleasantly.</p>

	<p>“Morning,” said Chipmunk, resuming his work.</p>

	<p>Doggie turned over a stable bucket and sat down on
	it and lit a cigarette.</p>

	<p>“Glad to be back?”</p>

	<p>Chipmunk poised the cloth on which he had poured
	some brown dressing. “Not if I has to be worried
	with private soljers,” he replied. “I came ’ere to
	get away from ’em.”</p>

	<p>“What’s wrong with private soldiers? They’re
	good enough for you, aren’t they?” asked Doggie
	with a laugh.</p>

	<p>“Naow,” snarled Chipmunk. “Especially when
	they ought to be orficers. Go to ’ell!”</p>

	<p>Doggie, who had suffered much in the army, but
	had never before been taunted with being a dilettante
	gentleman private, still less been consigned to hell on
	<a class="pagenum" id="page295" title="295"> </a>that account, leapt to his feet shaken by one of his
	rare sudden gusts of anger.</p>

	<p>“If you don’t say I’m as good a private soldier as
	any in your rotten, mangy regiment, I’ll knock your
	blinking head off!”</p>

	<p>An insult to a soldier’s regiment can only be wiped
	out in blood. Chipmunk threw cloth and legging to
	the winds and, springing from his seat like a monkey,
	went for Doggie.</p>

	<p>“You just try.”</p>

	<p>Doggie tried, and had not Chipmunk’s head been
	very firmly secured to his shoulders, he would have
	succeeded. Chipmunk went down as if he had been
	bombed. It was his unguarded and unscientific rush
	that did it. Doggie regarded his prostrate figure in
	gratified surprise.</p>

	<p>“What’s all this about?” cried a sharp, imperious
	voice.</p>

	<p>Doggie instinctively stood at attention and saluted,
	and Chipmunk, picking himself up in a dazed sort of
	way, did likewise.</p>

	<p>“You two men shake hands and make friends at
	once,” Oliver commanded.</p>

	<p>“Yes, sir,” said Doggie. He extended his hand,
	and Chipmunk, with the nautical shamble, which in
	moments of stress defied a couple of years’ military
	discipline, advanced and shook it. Oliver strode
	hurriedly away.</p>

	<p>“I’m sorry I said that about the regiment, mate.
	I didn’t mean it,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>Chipmunk looked uncertainly into Doggie’s eyes
	for what Doggie felt to be a very long time. Chipmunk’s
	dull brain was slowly realizing the situation.
	The man opposite to him was his master’s cousin.
	When he had last seen him, he had no title to be called
	<a class="pagenum" id="page296" title="296"> </a>a man at all. His vocabulary volcanically rich, but
	otherwise limited, had not been able to express him
	in adequate terms of contempt and derision. Now
	behold him masquerading as a private. Wounded.
	But any fool could get wounded. Behold him further
	coming down from the social heights whereon his
	master dwelt, to take a rise out of him, Chipmunk.
	In self-defence he had taken the obvious course. He
	had told him to go to hell. Then the important things
	had happened. Not the effeminate gentleman but
	some one very much like the common Tommy of his
	acquaintance had responded. And he had further
	responded with the familiar vigour but unwonted
	science of the rank and file. He had also stood at
	attention and saluted and obeyed like any common
	Tommy, when the Major appeared. The last fact
	appealed to him, perhaps, as much as the one more
	invested in violence.</p>

	<p>“’Ere,” said he at last, jerking his head and rubbing
	his jaw, “how the ’ell did you do it?”</p>

	<p>“We’ll get some gloves and I’ll show you,” said
	Doggie.</p>

	<p>So peace and firm friendship were made. Doggie
	went into the house and in the dining-room found
	Oliver in convulsive laughter.</p>

	<p>“Oh, my holy aunt! You’ll be the death of me,
	Doggie. ‘Yes, sir!’” He mimicked him. “The
	perfect Tommy. After doing in old Chipmunk.
	Chipmunk with the strength of a gorilla and the
	courage of a lion. I just happened round to see
	him go down. How the blazes did you manage it,
	Doggie?”</p>

	<p>“That’s what Chipmunk’s just asked me,” Doggie
	replied. “I belong to a regiment where boxing is
	taught. Really a good regiment,” he grinned.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page297" title="297"> </a>“There’s a sergeant-instructor, a chap called Ballinghall——”</p>

	<p>“Not Joe Ballinghall, the well-known amateur
	heavy-weight?”</p>

	<p>“That’s him right enough,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“My dear old chap,” said Oliver, “this is the funniest
	war that ever was.”</p>

	<p>Peggy sailed in full of apologies and began to pour
	out coffee.</p>

	<p>“Do help yourselves. I’m so sorry to have kept
	you poor hungry things waiting.”</p>

	<p>“We’ve filled up the time amazingly,” cried Oliver,
	waving a silver dish-cover. “What do you think?
	Doggie’s had a fight with Chipmunk and knocked
	him out.”</p>

	<p>Peggy splashed the milk over the brim of Doggie’s
	cup and into the saucer. There came a sudden
	flush on her cheek and a sudden hard look into her
	eyes.</p>

	<p>“Fighting? Do you mean to say you’ve been
	fighting with a common man like Chipmunk?”</p>

	<p>“We’re the best of friends now,” said Doggie.
	“We understand each other.”</p>

	<p>“I can’t quite see the necessity,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid it’s rather hard to explain,” he replied
	with a rueful knitting of the brows, for he realized
	her disgust at the vulgar brawl.</p>

	<p>“I think the less said the better,” she remarked
	acidly.</p>

	<p>The meal proceeded in ominous gloom, and as soon
	as Peggy had finished she left the room.</p>

	<p>“It seems, old chap, that I can never do right,”
	said Oliver. “Long ago, when I used to crab you,
	she gave it to me in the neck; and now when I try
	to boost you, you seem to get it.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page298" title="298"> </a>“I’m afraid I’ve got on Peggy’s nerves,” said
	Doggie. “You see, we’ve only met once before
	during the last two years, and I suppose I’ve changed.”</p>

	<p>“There’s no doubt about that, old son,” said Oliver.
	“But all the same, Peggy has stood by you like a brick,
	hasn’t she?”</p>

	<p>“That’s the devil of it,” replied Doggie, rubbing
	up his hair.</p>

	<p>“Why the devil of it?” Oliver asked quickly.</p>

	<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Doggie. “As you
	have once or twice observed, it’s a funny old war.”</p>

	<p>He rose, went to the door.</p>

	<p>“Where are you off to?” asked Oliver.</p>

	<p>“I’m going to Denby Hall to take a look round.”</p>

	<p>“Like me to come with you? We can borrow
	the two-seater.”</p>

	<p>Doggie advanced a pace. “You’re an awfully
	good sort, Oliver,” he said, touched, “but would you
	mind—I feel rather a beast——”</p>

	<p>“All right, you silly old ass,” cried Oliver cheerily.
	“You want, of course, to root about there by yourself.
	Go ahead.”</p>

	<p>“If you’ll take a spin with me this afternoon, or
	to-morrow——” said Doggie in his sensitive way.</p>

	<p>“Oh, clear out!” laughed Oliver.</p>

	<p>And Doggie cleared.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XXI"><a class="pagenum" id="page299" title="299"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">“All</span> right, Peddle, I can find my way about,”
	said Doggie, dismissing the old butler and
	his wife after a little colloquy in the hall.</p>

	<p>“Everything’s in perfect order, sir, just as it was
	when you left; and there are the keys,” said Mrs.
	Peddle.</p>

	<p>The Peddles retired. Doggie eyed the heavy
	bunch of keys with an air of distaste. For two years
	he had not seen a key. What on earth could be the
	good of all this locking and unlocking? He stuffed
	the bunch in his tunic pocket and looked around
	him. It seemed difficult to realize that everything
	he saw was his own. Those trees visible from the
	hall windows were his own, and the land on which
	they grew. This spacious, beautiful house was his
	own. He had only to wave a hand, as it were, and
	it would be filled with serving men and serving maids
	ready to do his bidding. His foot was on his native
	heath, and his name was James Marmaduke Trevor.</p>

	<p>Did he ever actually live here, have his being
	here? Was he ever part and parcel of it all—the
	Oriental rugs, the soft stair-carpet on the noble oak
	staircase leading to the gallery, the oil paintings, the
	impressive statuary, the solid, historical, oak hall
	furniture? Were it not so acutely remembered, he
	would have felt like a man accustomed all his life
	to barns and tents and hedgerows and fetid holes in
	the ground, who had wandered into some ill-guarded
	<a class="pagenum" id="page300" title="300"> </a>palace. He entered the drawing-room. The faithful
	Peddles, with pathetic zeal to give him a true
	home-coming, had set it out fresh and clean and
	polished; the windows were like crystal, and flowers
	welcomed him from every available vase. And so
	in the dining-room. The Chippendale dining-table
	gleamed like a sombre translucent pool. On the
	sideboard, amid the array of shining silver, the very
	best old Waterford decanters filled with whisky and
	brandy, and old cut-glass goblets invited him to refreshment.
	The precious mezzotint portraits, mostly of
	his own collecting, regarded him urbanely from the
	walls. <cite>The Times</cite> and the <cite>Morning Post</cite> were laid out
	on the little table by his accustomed chair near the
	massive marble mantelpiece.</p>

	<p>“The dear old idiots,” said Doggie, and he sat down
	for a moment and unfolded the newspapers and
	strewed them around, to give the impression that he
	had read and enjoyed them.</p>

	<p>And then he went into his own private and particular
	den, the peacock and ivory room, which had been
	the supreme expression of himself and for which he
	had ached during many nights of misery. He looked
	round and his heart sank. He seemed to come
	face to face with the ineffectual, effeminate creature
	who had brought upon him the disgrace of his man’s
	life. But for the creator and sybarite enjoyer of this
	sickening boudoir, he would now be in honoured
	command of men. He conceived a sudden violent
	hatred of the room. The only thing in the place
	worth a man’s consideration, save a few water-colours,
	was the honest grand piano, which, because it did not
	æsthetically harmonize with his squeaky, pot-bellied
	theorbos and tinkling spinet, he had hidden in an
	alcove behind a curtain. He turned an eye of disgust
	<a class="pagenum" id="page301" title="301"> </a>on the vellum backs of his books in the closed Chippendale
	cases, on the drawers containing his collection
	of wall-papers, on the footling peacocks, on the
	curtains and cushions, on the veined ivory paper which,
	beginning to fade two years ago, now looked mean and
	meaningless. It was an abominable room. It ought
	to be smelling of musk or pastilles or joss-sticks. It
	might have done so, for once he had tried something
	of the sort, and did not renew the experiment only
	because the smell happened to make him sick.</p>

	<p>There was one feature of the room at which for
	a long time he avoided looking: but wherever he
	turned, it impressed itself on his consciousness as the
	miserable genius of the despicable place. And that
	was his collection of little china dogs.</p>

	<p>At last he planted himself in front of the great
	glass cabinet, whence thousands of little dogs looked
	at him out of little black dots of eyes. There were
	dogs of all nationalities, all breeds, all twisted enormities
	of human invention. There were monstrous
	dogs of China and Japan; Aztec dogs; dogs in Sèvres
	and Dresden and Chelsea; sixpenny dogs from Austria
	and Switzerland; everything in the way of a
	little dog that man had made. He stood in front
	of it with almost a doggish snarl on his lips. He had
	spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds over these
	futile dogs. Yet never a flesh and blood, real, lusty
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">canis futilis</em> had he possessed. He used to dislike
	real dogs. The shivering rat, Goliath, could scarcely
	be called a dog. He had wasted his heart over these
	contemptible counterfeits. To add to his collection,
	catalogue it, describe it, correspond about it with the
	semi-imbecile Russian prince, his only rival collector,
	had once ranked with his history of wall-papers as
	the serious and absorbing pursuit of his life.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page302" title="302"> </a>Then suddenly Doggie’s hatred reached the crisis
	of ferocity. He saw red. He seized the first instrument
	of destruction that came to his hand, a little gilt
	Louis XV music stool, and bashed the cabinet full
	in front. The glass flew into a thousand splinters.
	He bashed again. The woodwork of the cabinet,
	stoutly resisting, worked hideous damage on the gilt
	stool. But Doggie went on bashing till the cabinet
	sank in ruins and the little dogs, headless, tailless,
	rent in twain, strewed the floor. Then Doggie
	stamped on them with his heavy munition boots
	until dogs and glass were reduced to powder and the
	Aubusson carpet was cut to pieces.</p>

	<p>“Damn the whole infernal place!” cried Doggie,
	and he heaved a mandolin tied up with disgusting
	peacock-blue ribbons at the bookcase, and fled from
	the room.</p>

	<p>He stood for a while in the hall, shaken with his
	anger; then mounted the staircase and went into his
	own bedroom with the satinwood furniture and nattier
	blue hangings. God! what a bedchamber for a
	man! He would have liked to throw bombs into the
	nest of effeminacy. But his mother had arranged
	it, so in a way it was immune from his iconoclastic
	rage. He went down to the dining-room, helped
	himself to a whisky and soda from the sideboard, and
	sat down in the arm-chair amidst the scattered newspapers
	and held his head in his hands and thought.</p>

	<p>The house was hateful; all its associations were
	hateful. If he lived there until he was ninety, the
	abhorred ghost of the pre-war little Doggie Trevor
	would always haunt every nook and cranny of the
	place, mouthing the quarter of a century’s shame that
	had culminated in the Great Disgrace. At last he
	brought his hand down with a bang on the arm of his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page303" title="303"> </a>chair. He would never live in this House of Dishonour
	again. Never. He would sell it.</p>

	<p>“By God!” he cried, starting to his feet, as the
	inspiration came.</p>

	<p>He would sell it, as it stood, lock, stock and barrel,
	with everything in it. He would wipe out at one
	stroke the whole of his unedifying history. Denby
	Hall gone, what could tie him to Durdlebury? He
	would be freed, for ever, from the petrification of the
	grey, cramping little city. If Peggy didn’t like it,
	that was Peggy’s affair. In material things he was
	master of his destiny. Peggy would have to follow
	him in his career, whatever it was, not he Peggy.
	He saw clearly that which had been mapped out for
	him, the silly little social ambitions, the useless existence,
	little Doggie Trevor for ever trailing obediently
	behind the lady of Denby Hall. Doggie threw himself
	back in his chair and laughed. No one had ever
	heard him laugh like that. After a while he was
	even surprised at himself.</p>

	<p>He was perfectly ready to marry Peggy. It was
	almost a preordained thing. A rupture of the
	engagement was unthinkable. Her undeviating
	loyalty bound him by every fibre of gratitude and
	honour. But it was essential that Peggy should
	know whom and what she was marrying. The
	Doggie trailing in her wake no longer existed. If
	she were prepared to follow the new Doggie, well
	and good. If not, there would be conflict. For that
	he was prepared.</p>

	<p>He strode, this time contemptuously, into his
	wrecked peacock and ivory room, where his telephone
	(blatant and hideous thing) was ingeniously concealed
	behind a screen, and rang up Spooner and Smithson,
	the leading firm of auctioneers and estate agents in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page304" title="304"> </a>the town. At the mention of his name, Mr. Spooner,
	the senior partner, came to the telephone.</p>

	<p>“Yes, I’m back, Mr. Spooner, and I’m quite
	well,” said Doggie. “I want to see you on very
	important business. When can you fix it up? Any
	time? Can you come along now to Denby Hall?”</p>

	<p>Mr. Spooner would be pleased to wait upon Mr.
	Trevor immediately. He would start at once. Doggie
	went out and sat on the front doorstep and smoked
	cigarettes till he came.</p>

	<p>“Mr. Spooner,” said he, as soon as the elderly
	auctioneer descended from his little car, “I’m
	going to sell the whole of the Denby Hall estate, and,
	with the exception of a few odds and ends, family
	relics and so forth, which I’ll pick out, all the contents
	of the house—furniture, pictures, sheets, towels and
	kitchen clutter. I’ve only got six days’ leave, and I
	want all the worries, as far as I am concerned, settled
	and done with before I go. So you’ll have to buck
	up, Mr. Spooner. If you say you can’t do it, I’ll
	put the business by telephone into the hands of a
	London agent.”</p>

	<p>It took Mr. Spooner nearly a quarter of an hour
	to recover his breath, gain a grasp of the situation and
	assemble his business wits.</p>

	<p>“Of course I’ll carry out your instructions, Mr.
	Trevor,” he said at last. “You can safely leave the
	matter in our hands. But, although it is against my
	business interests, pray let me beg you to reconsider
	your decision. It is such a beautiful home, your
	grandfather, the Bishop’s, before you.”</p>

	<p>“He bought it pretty cheap, didn’t he, somewhere
	in the ’seventies?”</p>

	<p>“I forget the price he paid for it, but I could look
	it up. Of course we were the agents.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page305" title="305"> </a>“And then it was let to some dismal people until
	my father died and my mother took it over. I’m
	sorry I can’t get sentimental about it, as if it were an
	ancestral hall, Mr. Spooner. I want to get rid of
	the place, because I hate the sight of it.”</p>

	<p>“It would be presumptuous of me to say anything
	more,” answered the old-fashioned country auctioneer.</p>

	<p>“Say what you like, Mr. Spooner,” laughed Doggie
	in his disarming way. “We’re old friends. But
	send in your people this afternoon to start on inventories
	and measuring up, or whatever they do, and I’ll
	look round to-morrow and select the bits I may want
	to keep. You’ll see after the storing of them, won’t
	you?”</p>

	<p>“Of course, Mr. Trevor.”</p>

	<p>Mr. Spooner drove away in his little car, a much
	dazed man.</p>

	<p>Like the rest of Durdlebury and the circumjacent
	county, he had assumed that when the war was over
	Mr. James Marmaduke Trevor would lead his bride
	from the Deanery into Denby Hall, where the latter,
	in her own words, would proceed to make things
	hum.</p>

	<p>“My dear,” said he to his wife at luncheon, “you
	could have knocked me over with a feather. What
	he’s doing it for, goodness knows. I can only assume
	that he has grown so accustomed to the destruction
	of property in France, that he has got bitten by the
	fever.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps Peggy Conover has turned him down,”
	suggested his wife, who, much younger than he,
	employed more modern turns of speech. “And I
	shouldn’t wonder if she has. Since the war girls
	aren’t on the look out for pretty monkeys.”</p>

	<p>“If Miss Conover thinks she has got hold of a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page306" title="306"> </a>pretty monkey in that young man, she is very much
	mistaken,” replied Mr. Spooner.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile Doggie summoned Peddle to the hall.
	He knew that his announcement would be a blow to
	the old man; but this was a world of blows; and
	after all, one could not organize one’s life to suit the
	sentiments of old family idiots of retainers, served they
	never so faithfully.</p>

	<p>“Peddle,” said he, “I’m sorry to say I’m going
	to sell Denby Hall. Messrs. Spooner and Smithson’s
	people are coming in this afternoon. So give them
	every facility. Also tea, or beer, or whisky, or whatever
	they want. About what’s going to happen to
	you and Mrs. Peddle, don’t worry a bit. I’ll look
	after that. You’ve been jolly good friends of mine
	all my life, and I’ll see that everything’s as right as
	rain.”</p>

	<p>He turned, before the amazed old butler could
	reply, and marched away. Peddle gaped at his
	retreating figure. If those were the ways which
	Mr. Marmaduke had learned in the army, the lower
	sank the army in Peddle’s estimation. To sell
	Denby Hall over his head! Why, the place and all
	about it was <em>his</em>! So deeply are squatters’ rights
	implanted in the human instinct.</p>

	<p>Doggie marched along the familiar high road,
	strangely exhilarated. What was to be his future
	he neither knew nor cared. At any rate, it would
	not lie in Durdlebury. He had cut out Durdlebury
	for ever from his scheme of existence. If he got
	through the war, he and Peggy would go out somewhere
	into the great world where there was man’s
	work to do. Parliament! Peggy had suggested it
	as a sort of country gentleman’s hobby that would
	keep him amused during the London seasons—so
	<a class="pagenum" id="page307" title="307"> </a>might prospective bride have talked to prospective
	husband fifty years ago. Parliament! God help
	him and God help Peggy if ever he got into Parliament.
	He would speak the most unpopular truths
	about the race of politicians if ever he got into Parliament.
	Peggy would wish that neither of them had
	ever been born. He held the trenches’ views on
	politicians. No fear. No muddy politics as an
	elegant amusement for him. He laughed as he had
	laughed in the dining-room at Denby Hall.</p>

	<p>He would have a bad quarter of an hour with
	Peggy. Naturally. She would say, and with every
	right: “What about me? Am I not to be considered?”
	Yes, of course she would be considered.
	The position his fortune assured him would always be
	hers. He had no notion of asking her to share a
	log cabin in the wilds of Canada, or to bury herself
	in Oliver’s dud island of Huaheine. The great
	world would be before them. “But give me some
	sort of an idea of what you propose to do,” she would
	with perfect propriety demand. And there Doggie
	was stuck. He had not the ghost of a programme.
	All he had was faith in the war, faith in the British
	spirit and genius that would bring it to a perfect end,
	in which there would be unimagined opportunities
	for a man to fling himself into a new life, and new
	conditions, and begin the new work of a new civilization.</p>

	<p>“If she’ll only understand,” said he, “that I
	can’t go back to those blasted little dogs, all will be
	well.”</p>

	<p>Not quite all. Although his future was as nebulous
	as the planetary system in the Milky Way, at the back
	of his mind was a vague conviction that it would be
	connected somehow with the welfare of those men
	<a class="pagenum" id="page308" title="308"> </a>whom he had learned to know and love: the men to
	whom reading was little pleasure, writing a school-child’s
	laborious task, the glories of the earth as interpreted
	through art a sealed book; the men whose
	daily speech was foul metaphor; the men, hemi-demi-semi-educated,
	whose crude socialistic opinions
	the open lessons of history and the eternal facts of
	human nature derisively refuted; the men who had
	sweated and slaved in factory and in field to no other
	purpose than to obey the biological laws of the perpetuation
	of the species; yet the men with the sweet minds
	of children, the gushing tenderness of women, the hearts
	of lions; the men compared to whom the rotten
	squealing heroes of Homer were a horde of cowardly
	savages. They were <em>men</em>, these comrades of his,
	swift with all that there can be of divine glory in
	men.</p>

	<p>And when they came home and the high gods
	sounded the false trumpet of peace?</p>

	<p>There would be men’s work in England for all
	the Doggies in England to do.</p>

	<p>Again, if Peggy could understand this, all would
	be well. If she missed the point altogether, and
	tauntingly advised him to go and join his friends the
	Socialists at once—then—he shoved his cap to the
	back of his head and wrinkled his forehead—then——</p>

	<p>“Everything will be in the soup,” said he.</p>

	<p>These reflections brought him to the Deanery.
	The nearest way of entrance was the stable-yard gate,
	which was always open. He strode in, waved a hand
	to Chipmunk who was sitting on the ground with his
	back against the garage, smoking a pipe, and entered
	the house by the French window of the dining-room.
	Where should he find Peggy? His whole mind
	was set on the immediate interview. Obviously
	<a class="pagenum" id="page309" title="309"> </a>the drawing-room was the first place of search. He
	opened the drawing-room door, the hinges and lock
	oily, noiseless, perfectly ordained, like everything
	in the perfectly ordained English Deanery, and strode
	in.</p>

	<p>His entrance was so swift, so protected from sound,
	that the pair had no time to start apart before he was
	there, with his amazed eyes full upon them. Peggy’s
	hands were on Oliver’s shoulders, tears were streaming
	down her face, as her head was thrown back from him,
	and Oliver’s arm was around her. Her back was
	to the door. Oliver withdrew his arm and retired a
	pace or two.</p>

	<p>“Lord Almighty,” he whispered, “here’s Doggie!”</p>

	<p>Then Peggy, realizing what had happened, wheeled
	round and stared tragically at Doggie, who, preoccupied
	with the search for her, had not removed his cap.
	He drew himself up.</p>

	<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said with imperturbable
	irony, and turned.</p>

	<p>Oliver rushed across the room.</p>

	<p>“Stop, you silly fool!”</p>

	<p>He slammed the open door, caught Doggie by the
	arm and dragged him away from the threshold. His
	blue eyes blazed and the lips beneath the short-cropped
	moustache quivered.</p>

	<p>“It’s all my fault, Doggie. I’m a beast and a
	cad and anything you like to call me. But for things
	you said last night—well—no, hang it all, there’s
	no excuse. Everything’s on me. Peggy’s as true
	as gold.”</p>

	<p>Peggy, red-eyed, pale-cheeked, stood a little way
	back, silent, on the defensive. Doggie, looking from
	one to the other, said quietly:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page310" title="310"> </a>“A triangular explanation is scarcely decent.
	Perhaps you might let me have a word or two with
	Peggy.”</p>

	<p>“Yes. It would be best,” she whispered.</p>

	<p>“I’ll be in the dining-room if you want me,”
	said Oliver, and went out.</p>

	<p>Doggie took her hand and, very gently, led her
	to a chair.</p>

	<p>“Let us sit down. There,” said he, “now we
	can talk more comfortably. First, before we touch
	on this situation, let me say something to you. It may
	ease things.”</p>

	<p>Peggy, humiliated, did not look at him. She
	nodded.</p>

	<p>“All right.”</p>

	<p>“I made up my mind this morning to sell Denby
	Hall and its contents. I’ve given old Spooner instructions.”</p>

	<p>She glanced at him involuntarily. “Sell Denby
	Hall?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, dear. You see, I have made up my mind
	definitely, if I’m spared, not to live in Durdlebury
	after the war.”</p>

	<p>“What were you thinking of doing?” she asked,
	in a low voice.</p>

	<p>“That would depend on after-war circumstances.
	Anyhow, I was coming to you, when I entered the
	room, with my decision. I knew, of course, that it
	wouldn’t please you—that you would have something
	to say to it—perhaps something very serious.”</p>

	<p>“What do you mean by something very serious?”</p>

	<p>“Our little contract, dear,” said Doggie, “was
	based on the understanding that you would not be
	uprooted from the place in which are all your life’s
	associations. If I broke that understanding it would
	<a class="pagenum" id="page311" title="311"> </a>leave you a free agent to determine the contract, as
	the lawyers say. So perhaps, Peggy dear, we might
	dismiss—well—other considerations, and just discuss
	this.”</p>

	<p>Peggy twisted a rag of handkerchief and wavered
	for a moment. Then she broke out, with fresh tears
	on her cheek.</p>

	<p>“You’re a dear of dears to put it that way. Only
	you could do it. I’ve been a brute, old boy; but I
	couldn’t help it. I <em>did</em> try to play the game.”</p>

	<p>“You did, Peggy dear. You’ve been wonderful.”</p>

	<p>“And although it didn’t look like it, I was trying
	to play the game when you came in. I really was.
	And so was he.” She rose and threw the handkerchief
	away from her. “I’m not going to step out
	of the engagement by the side door you’ve left open
	for me, you dear old simple thing. It stands if you
	like. We’re all honourable people, and Oliver”—she
	drew a sharp little breath—“Oliver will go out
	of our lives.”</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled—he had risen—and taking her
	hands, kissed them.</p>

	<p>“I’ve never known what a splendid Peggy it is,
	until I lose her. Look here, dear, here’s the whole
	thing in a nutshell. While I’ve been morbidly occupied
	with myself and my grievances and my disgrace
	and my efforts to pull through, and have gradually
	developed into a sort of half-breed between a Tommy
	and a gentleman with every mortal thing in me warped
	and changed, you’ve stuck to the original rotten ass
	you lashed into the semblance of a man, in this very
	room, goodness knows how many months, or years,
	or centuries ago. In my infernal selfishness, I’ve
	treated you awfully badly.”</p>

	<p>“No, you haven’t,” she decided stoutly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page312" title="312"> </a>“Yes, I have. The ordinary girl would have
	told a living experiment like me to go hang long
	before this. But you didn’t. And now you see a
	totally different sort of Doggie and you’re making
	yourself miserable because he’s a queer, unsympathetic,
	unfamiliar stranger.”</p>

	<p>“All that may be so,” she said, meeting his eyes
	bravely. “But if the unfamiliar Doggie still cares
	for me, it doesn’t matter.”</p>

	<p>Here was a delicate situation. Two very tender-skinned
	vanities opposed to each other. The smart
	of seeing one’s affianced bride in the arms of another
	man hurts grievously sore. It’s a primitive sex affair,
	independent of love in its modern sense. If the savage’s
	abandoned squaw runs off with another fellow,
	he pursues him with clubs and tomahawks until he
	has avenged the insult. Having known ME, to
	decline to Spotted Crocodile! So the finest flower
	of civilization cannot surrender the lady who once was
	his to the more favoured male without a primitive
	pang. On the other hand, Doggie knew very well
	that he did not love Peggy, that he had never loved
	Peggy. But how in common decency could a man
	tell a girl, who had wasted a couple of years of her
	life over him, that he had never loved her? Instead
	of replying to her questions, he walked about the
	room in a worried way.</p>

	<p>“I take it,” said Peggy incisively, after a while,
	“that you don’t care for me any longer.”</p>

	<p>He turned and halted at the challenge. He snapped
	his fingers. What was the good of all this beating
	of the bush?</p>

	<p>“Look here, Peggy, let’s face it out. If you’ll
	confess that you and Oliver are in love with each other,
	I’ll confess to a girl in France.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page313" title="313"> </a>“Oh?” said Peggy, with a swift change to coolness.
	“There’s a girl in France, is there? How
	long has this been going on?”</p>

	<p>“The last four days in billets before I got wounded,”
	said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“What is she like?”</p>

	<p>Then Doggie suddenly laughed out loud and took
	her by the shoulders in a grasp rougher than she had
	ever dreamed to lie in the strength or nature of Marmaduke
	Trevor, and kissed her the heartiest, honestest
	kiss she had ever had from man, and rushed out of the
	room.</p>

	<p>Presently he returned, dragging with him the
	disconsolate Major.</p>

	<p>“Here,” said he, “fix it up between you. I’ve
	told Peggy about a girl in France and she wants to
	know what she’s like.”</p>

	<p>Peggy, shaken by the rude grip and the kiss, flashed
	and cried rebelliously:</p>

	<p>“I’m not quite so sure that I want to fix it up with
	Oliver.”</p>

	<p>“Oh yes, you do,” cried Oliver.</p>

	<p>He snatched up Doggie’s cap and jammed it on
	Doggie’s head and cried:</p>

	<p>“Doggie, you’re the best and truest and finest of
	dear old chaps in the whole wide world.”</p>

	<p>Doggie settled his cap, grinned, and moved to the
	door.</p>

	<p>“Anything else, sir?”</p>

	<p>Oliver roared, delighted: “No, Private Trevor,
	you can go.”</p>

	<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

	<p>Doggie saluted smartly and went out. He passed
	through the French window of the dining-room into
	the mellow autumn sunshine. Found himself standing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page314" title="314"> </a>in front of Chipmunk, who still smoked the pipe
	of elegant leisure by the door of the garage.</p>

	<p>“This is a dam good old world all the same. Isn’t
	it?” said he.</p>

	<p>“If it was always like this, it would have its points,”
	replied the unworried Chipmunk.</p>

	<p>Doggie had an inspiration. He looked at his
	watch. It was nearly one o’clock.</p>

	<p>“Hungry?”</p>

	<p>“Always ’ungry. Specially about dinner-time.”</p>

	<p>“Come along of me to the Downshire Arms and
	have a bite of dinner.”</p>

	<p>Chipmunk rose slowly to his feet, and put his pipe
	into his tunic pocket, and jerked a slow thumb backwards.</p>

	<p>“Ain’t yer having yer meals ’ere?”</p>

	<p>“Only now and then, as sort of treats,” said Doggie.
	“Come along.”</p>

	<p>“Ker-ist!” said Chipmunk. “Can yer wait a bit
	until I’ve cleaned me buttons?”</p>

	<p>“Oh, bust your old buttons!” laughed Doggie.
	“I’m hungry.”</p>

	<p>So the pair of privates marched through the old
	city to the Downshire Arms, the select, old-world
	hotel of Durdlebury, where Doggie was known
	since babyhood; and there, sitting at a window table
	with Chipmunk, he gave Durdlebury the great
	sensation of its life. If the Dean himself, clad in
	tights and spangles, had juggled for pence by the west
	door of the cathedral, tongues could scarcely have
	wagged faster. But Doggie worried his head about
	gossip not one jot. He was in joyous mood and ordered
	a gargantuan feast for Chipmunk and bottles of the
	strongest old Burgundy, such as he thought would
	get a grip on Chipmunk’s whiskyfied throat; and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page315" title="315"> </a>under the genial influence of food and drink, Chipmunk
	told him tales of far lands and strange adventures;
	and when they emerged much later into the quiet
	streets, it was the great good fortune of Chipmunk’s
	life that there was not the ghost of an Assistant Provost-Marshal
	in Durdlebury.</p>

	<p>“Doggie, old man,” said Oliver afterwards, “my
	wonder and reverence for you increases hour by
	hour. You are the only man in the whole world
	who has ever made Chipmunk drunk.”</p>

	<p>“You see,” said Doggie modestly, “I don’t think
	he ever really loved anyone who fed him before.”</p>

	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Doggie,</span> the lightest-hearted private in the
	British Army, danced, in a metaphorical
	sense, back to London, where he stayed for the rest
	of his leave at his rooms in Woburn Place; took his
	wholesome fill of theatres and music-halls, going to
	those parts of the house where Tommies congregate;
	and bought an old Crown Derby dinner service as a
	wedding present for Peggy and Oliver, a tortoise-shell-fitted
	dressing-case for Peggy, and for Oliver
	a magnificent gold watch that was an encyclopædia
	of current information. He had never felt so happy
	in his life, so enchanted with the grimly smiling old
	world. Were it not for the Boche, it could hold its
	own as a brave place with any planet going. He
	blessed Oliver, who, in turn, had blessed him as though
	he had displayed heroic magnanimity. He blessed
	Peggy, who, flushed with love and happiness and
	gratitude, had shown him, for the first time, what a
	really adorable young woman she could be. He
	thanked Heaven for making three people happy,
	instead of three people miserable.</p>

	<p>He marched along the wet pavements with a new
	light in his eyes, with a new exhilarating breath in
	his nostrils. He was free. The war over, he could
	do exactly what he liked. An untrammelled future
	lay before him. During the war he could hop about
	trenches and shell-holes with the freedom of a bird….</p>

	<p>Those awful duty letters to Peggy! Only now
	<a class="pagenum" id="page317" title="317"> </a>he fully realized their never-ending strain. Now
	he could write to her spontaneously, whenever the
	mood suited, write to her from his heart: “Dear
	old Peggy, I’m so glad you’re happy. Oliver’s a
	splendid chap. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.” He
	had lost a dreaded bride; but he had found a dear
	and devoted friend. Nay, more: he had found
	two devoted friends. When he drew up his account
	with humanity, he found himself passing rich in love.</p>

	<p>His furlough expired, he reported at his depot, and
	was put on light duty. He went about it the cheeriest
	soul alive, and laughed at the memory of his former
	miseries as a recruit. This camp life in England,
	after the mud and blood of France—like the African
	gentleman in Mr. Addison’s “Cato,” he blessed his
	stars and thought it luxury. He was not sorry that
	the exigencies of service prevented him from being
	present at the wedding of Oliver and Peggy. For it
	was the most sudden of phenomena, like the fight of
	two rams, as Shakespeare hath it. In war-time people
	marry in haste; and often, dear God, they have not
	the leisure to repent. Since the beginning of the war
	there are many, many women twice widowed….
	But that is by the way. Doggie was grateful to an
	ungrateful military system. If he had attended—in
	the capacity of best man, so please you—so violent
	and unreasoning had Oliver’s affection become,
	Durdlebury would have gaped and whispered behind
	its hand and made things uncomfortable for everybody.
	Doggie from the security of his regiment wished
	them joy by letter and telegram, and sent them the
	wedding presents aforesaid.</p>

	<p>Then for a season there were three happy people,
	at least, in this war-wilderness of suffering. The
	newly wedded pair went off for a honeymoon, whose
	<a class="pagenum" id="page318" title="318"> </a>promise of indefinite length was eventually cut short
	by an unromantic War Office. Oliver returned to
	his regiment in France and Peggy to the Deanery,
	where she sat among her wedding presents and her
	hopes for the future.</p>

	<p>“I never realized, my dear,” said the Dean to his
	wife, “what a remarkably pretty girl Peggy has
	grown into.”</p>

	<p>“It’s because she has got the man she loves,” said
	Mrs. Conover.</p>

	<p>“Do you think that’s the reason?”</p>

	<p>“I’ve known the plainest of women become quite
	good-looking. In the early days of our married
	life”—she smiled—“even I was not quite unattractive.”</p>

	<p>The old Dean bent down—she was sitting and he
	standing—and lifted her chin with his forefinger.</p>

	<p>“You, my dear, have always been by far the most
	beautiful woman of my acquaintance.”</p>

	<p>“We’re talking of Peggy,” smiled Mrs. Conover.</p>

	<p>“Ah!” said the Dean. “So we were. I was
	saying that the child’s happiness was reflected in her
	face——”</p>

	<p>“I rather thought I said it, dear,” replied Mrs.
	Conover.</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t matter,” said her husband, who was
	first a man and then a dean. He waved a hand in
	benign dismissal of the argument. “It’s a great
	mercy,” said he, “that she has married the man she
	loves instead of—well … Marmaduke has turned
	out a capital fellow, and a credit to the family—but
	I never was quite easy in my mind over the engagement….
	And yet,” he continued, after a turn or
	two about the room, “I’m rather conscience-stricken
	about Marmaduke, poor chap. He has taken it like
	<a class="pagenum" id="page319" title="319"> </a>a brick. Yes, my dear, like a brick. Like a gentleman.
	But all the same, no man likes to see another
	fellow walk off with his sweetheart.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t think Marmaduke was ever so bucked
	in his life,” said Mrs. Conover placidly.</p>

	<p>“So——?”</p>

	<p>The Dean gasped. His wife’s smile playing
	ironically among her wrinkles was rather beautiful.</p>

	<p>“Peggy’s word, Edward, not mine. The modern
	vocabulary. It means——”</p>

	<p>“Oh, I know what the hideous word means. It
	was your using it that caused a shiver down my spine.
	But why bucked?”</p>

	<p>“It appears there’s a girl in France.”</p>

	<p>“Oho!” said the Dean. “Who is she?”</p>

	<p>“That’s what Peggy, even now, would give a
	good deal to find out.”</p>

	<p>For Doggie had told Peggy nothing more about
	the girl in France. Jeanne was his own precious
	secret. That it was shared by Phineas and Mo
	didn’t matter. To discuss her with Peggy, besides
	being irrelevant, in the circumstances, was quite
	another affair. Indeed, when he had avowed the girl
	in France, it was not so much a confession as a gallant
	desire to help Peggy out of her predicament. For,
	after all, what was Jeanne but a beloved war-wraith
	that had passed through his life and disappeared?</p>

	<p>“The development of Marmaduke,” said the
	Dean, “is not the least extraordinary phenomenon
	of the war.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Now that Doggie had gained his freedom, Jeanne
	ceased to be a wraith. She became once again a
	wonderful thing of flesh and blood towards whom
	all his young, fresh instinct yearned tremendously.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page320" title="320"> </a>One day it struck his ingenuous mind that, if Jeanne
	were willing, there could be no possible reason why
	he should not marry her. Who was to say him nay?
	Convention? He had put all the conventions of his
	life under the auctioneer’s hammer. The family?
	He pictured a meeting between Jeanne and the kind
	and courteous old Dean. It could not be other than
	an episode of beauty. All he had to do was to seek
	out Jeanne and begin his wooing in earnest. The
	simplest adventure in the world for a well-to-do and
	unattached young man—if only that young man had
	not been a private soldier on active service.</p>

	<p>That was the rub. Doggie passed his hand over
	his hair ruefully. How on earth could he get to
	Frélus again? Not till the end of the war, at any
	rate, which might be years hence. There was nothing
	for it but a resumption of intimacy by letter. So he
	wrote to Jeanne the letter which loyalty to Peggy
	had made him destroy weeks ago. But no answer
	came. Then he wrote another, telling her of Peggy
	and his freedom, and his love and his hopes, and to
	that there came no reply.</p>

	<p>A prepaid telegram produced no result.</p>

	<p>Doggie began to despair. What had happened to
	Jeanne? Why did she persist in ruling him out of
	her existence? Was it because, in spite of her gratitude,
	she wanted none of his love? He sat on the
	railing on the sea front of the south coast town where
	he was quartered, and looked across the Channel in
	dismayed apprehension. He was a fool. What could
	there possibly be in little Doggie Trevor to inspire
	a romantic passion in any woman’s heart? Take
	Peggy’s case. As soon as a real, genuine fellow like
	Oliver came along, Peggy’s heart flew out to him like
	needle to magnet. Even had he been of Oliver’s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page321" title="321"> </a>Paladin mould, what right had he to expect Jeanne
	to give him all the wonder of herself after a four days’
	acquaintance? Being what he was, just little Doggie
	Trevor, the assumption was an impertinence. She
	had sheltered herself from it behind a barrier of
	silence.</p>

	<p>A girl, a thing of low-cut blouse, truncated skirts
	and cheap silk stockings, who had been leaning unnoticed
	for some time on the rails by his side, spoke.</p>

	<p>“You seem to be pretty lonely.”</p>

	<p>Doggie swerved round. “Yes, I am, darned
	lonely.”</p>

	<p>“Come for a walk, or take me to the pictures.”</p>

	<p>“And then?” asked Doggie, swinging to his feet.</p>

	<p>“If we get on all right, we can fix up something
	for to-morrow.”</p>

	<p>She was pretty, with a fair, frizzy, insolent prettiness.
	She might have been any age from fourteen to four-and-twenty.</p>

	<p>Doggie smiled, tempted to while away a dark hour.
	But he said, honestly:</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid I should be a dull companion.”</p>

	<p>“What’s the matter?” she laughed. “Lost
	your best girl?”</p>

	<p>“Something like it.” He waved a hand across the
	sea. “Over there.”</p>

	<p>“French? Oh!” She drew herself up.
	“Aren’t English girls good enough for you?”</p>

	<p>“When they’re sympathetic, they’re delightful,”
	said he.</p>

	<p>“Oh, you make me tired! Good-bye,” she
	snapped, and stalked away.</p>

	<p>After a few yards she glanced over her shoulder to
	see whether he was following. But Doggie remained
	by the railings.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page322" title="322"> </a>Presently he shrugged his shoulders and went off
	to a picture palace by himself and thought wistfully
	of Jeanne.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">And Jeanne? Well, Jeanne was no longer at
	Frélus; for there came a morning when Aunt Morin
	was found dead in her bed. The old doctor came and
	spread out his thin hands and said “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien</em>” and
	“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que voulez-vous?</em>” and “It was bound to happen
	sooner or later,” and murmured learned words. The
	old curé came and a neighbour or two, and candles
	were put round the coffin and the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pompes funèbres</em>
	draped the front steps and entrance and vestibule in
	heavy black. And as soon as was possible Aunt Morin
	was laid to rest in the little cemetery adjoining the
	church, and Jeanne went back to the house with
	Toinette, alone in the wide world. And because
	there had been a death in the place the billeted soldiers
	went about the courtyard very quietly.</p>

	<p>Since Phineas and Mo and Doggie’s regiment had
	gone away, she had devoted, with a new passionate
	zeal, all the time she could spare from the sick woman
	to the comforts of the men. No longer restrained by
	the tightly drawn purse-strings of Aunt Morin, but
	with money of her own to spend—and money restored
	to her by these men’s dear and heroic comrade—she
	could give them unexpected treats of rich coffee and
	milk, fresh eggs, fruit…. She mended and darned
	for them and suborned old women to help her. She
	conspired with the Town Major to render the granary
	more habitable; and the Town Major, who had not
	to issue a return for a centime’s expense, received all
	her suggestions with courteous enthusiasm. Toinette
	taking good care to impress upon every British soldier
	who could understand her, the fact that to mademoiselle
	<a class="pagenum" id="page323" title="323"> </a>personally and individually he was indebted for all
	these luxuries, the fame of Jeanne began to spread
	through that sector of the front behind which lay
	Frélus. Concurrently spread the story of Doggie
	Trevor’s exploit. Jeanne became a legendary figure,
	save to those thrice fortunate who were billeted on
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Veuve Morin et Fils, Marchands des Foins en Gros et
	Détail</em>, and these, according to their several stolid
	British ways, bowed down and worshipped before
	the slim French girl with the tragic eyes, and when
	they departed, confirmed the legend and made things
	nasty for the sceptically superior private.</p>

	<p>So, on the day of the funeral of Aunt Morin, the
	whole of the billet sent in a wreath to the house, and
	the whole of the billet attended the service in the little
	church, and they marched back and drew up by the
	front door—a guard of honour extending a little distance
	down the road. The other men billeted in
	the village hung around, together with the remnant
	of the inhabitants, old men, women and children,
	but kept quite clear of the guarded path through
	which Jeanne was to pass. One or two officers looked
	on curiously. But they stood in the background. It
	was none of their business. If the men, in their
	free time, chose to put themselves on parade, without
	arms, of course, so much the better for the army.</p>

	<p>Then Jeanne and the old curé, in his time-scarred
	shovel-hat and his rusty soutane, followed by Toinette,
	turned round the corner of the lane and emerged
	into the main street. A sergeant gave a word of
	command. The guard stood at attention. Jeanne
	and her companions proceeded up the street, unaware of
	the unusual, until they entered between the first two
	files. Then for the first time the tears welled into
	Jeanne’s eyes. She could only stretch out her hands
	<a class="pagenum" id="page324" title="324"> </a>and cry somewhat wildly to the bronzed statues on
	each side of her, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, mes amis, merci, merci</em>,”
	and flee into the house.</p>

	<p>The next day Maître Pépineau, the notary, summoned
	her to his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinet</em>. Maître Pépineau was very
	old. His partner had gone off to the war. “One
	of the necessities of the present situation,” he would
	say, “is that I should go on living in spite of myself;
	for if I died, the whole of the affairs of Frélus would
	be in the soup.” Now, a fortnight back, Maître
	Pépineau and four neighbours—the four witnesses
	required by French law when there is only one notary
	to draw up the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instrument public</em>—had visited Aunt
	Morin; so Jeanne knew that she had made a fresh will.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon enfant</em>,” said the old man, unfolding the
	document, “in a previous will your aunt had left you
	a little heritage out of the half of her fortune which
	she was free to dispose of by the code. You having
	come into possession of your own money, she has
	revoked that will and left everything to her only
	surviving son, Gaspard Morin, in Madagascar.”</p>

	<p>“It is only just and right,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“The unfortunate part of the matter,” said Maître
	Pépineau, “is that Madame Morin has appointed
	official trustees to carry on the estate until Monsieur
	Gaspard Morin can make his own arrangements. The
	result is that you have no <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus standi</em> as a resident in
	the house. I pointed this out to her. But you know,
	in spite of her good qualities, she was obstinate….
	It pains me greatly, my dear child, to have to state
	your position.”</p>

	<p>“I am then,” said Jeanne, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans-asile</em>—homeless?”</p>

	<p>“As far as the house of Monsieur Gaspard Morin
	is concerned—yes.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page325" title="325"> </a>“And my English soldiers?” asked Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“Alas, my child,” replied the old man, “you will
	find them everywhere.”</p>

	<p>Which was cold consolation. For however much
	inspired by patriotic gratitude a French girl may be,
	she cannot settle down in a strange place where British
	troops are billeted and proceed straightway to minister
	to their comfort. Misunderstandings are apt to arise
	even in the best regulated British regiments. In the
	house of Aunt Morin, in Frélus, her position was
	unassailable. Anywhere else …</p>

	<p>“So, my good Toinette,” said Jeanne, after having
	explained the situation to the indignant old woman,
	“I can only go back to my friend in Paris and reconstitute
	my life. If you will accompany me——?”</p>

	<p>But no. Toinette had the peasant’s awful dread
	of Paris. She had heard about Paris: there were
	thieves, ruffians that they called <em>apaches</em>, who murdered
	you if you went outside your door.</p>

	<p>“The <em>apaches</em>,” laughed Jeanne, “were swept away
	into the army on the outbreak of war, and they’ve
	nearly all been killed, fighting like heroes.”</p>

	<p>“There are the old ones left, who are worse than
	the young,” retorted Toinette.</p>

	<p>No. Mademoiselle could teach her nothing about
	Paris. You could not even cross a street without
	risk of life, so many were the omnibuses and automobiles.
	In every shop you were a stranger to be
	robbed. There was no air in Paris. You could not
	sleep for the noise. And then—to live in a city of
	a hundred million people and not know a living soul!
	It was a mad-house matter. Again no. It grieved
	her to part from mademoiselle, but she had made her
	little economies—a difficult achievement, considering
	how regardful of her pence Madame had been—and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page326" title="326"> </a>she would return to her Breton town, which forty
	years ago she had left to enter the service of Madame
	Morin.</p>

	<p>“But after forty years, Toinette, who in Paimpol
	will remember you?”</p>

	<p>“It is I who remember Paimpol,” said Toinette.
	She remained for a few moments in thought. Then
	she said: “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est drôle, tout de même.</em> I haven’t seen
	the sea for forty years, and now I can’t sleep of nights
	thinking of it. The first man I loved was a fisherman
	of Paimpol. We were to be married after he returned
	from an Iceland voyage, with a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gros bénéfice</em>. When
	the time came for his return, I would stand on the
	shore and watch and watch the sea. But he never
	came. The sea swallowed him up. And then—you
	can understand quite well—the child was born
	dead. And I thought I would never want to look
	at the sea again. So I came here to your Aunt
	Morin, the daughter of Doctor Kersadec, your grandfather,
	and I married Jules Dagnant, the foreman of
	the carters of the hay … and he died a long time
	ago … and now I have forgotten him and I want
	to go and look at the sea where my man was drowned.”</p>

	<p>“But your grandson, who is fighting in the
	Argonne?”</p>

	<p>“What difference can it make to him whether I
	am in Frélus or Paimpol?”</p>

	<p>“That’s true,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>Toinette bustled about the kitchen. Folks had to
	eat, whatever happened. But she went on talking,
	Madame Morin. One must not speak evil of the
	dead. They have their work cut out to extricate
	themselves from Purgatory. But all the same—after
	forty years’ faithful service—and not to mention in
	the will—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">même pour une Bretonne, c’était raide</em>.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page327" title="327"> </a>Jeanne agreed. She had no reason to love her Aunt
	Morin. Her father’s people came from Agen on the
	confines of Gascony; he had been a man of great
	gestures and vehement speech; her mother, gentle,
	reserved, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un pen dévote</em>. Jeanne drew her character
	from both sources; but her sympathies were rather
	southern than northern. For some reason or the
	other, perhaps for his expansive ways—who knows?—Aunt
	Morin had held the late Monsieur Bossière in
	detestation. She had no love for Jeanne, and Jeanne,
	who before her good fortune had expected nothing
	from Aunt Morin, regarded the will with feelings of
	indifference. Except as far as it concerned Toinette.
	Forty years’ faithful service deserved recognition. But
	what was the use of talking about it?</p>

	<p>“So we must separate, Toinette?”</p>

	<p>“Alas, yes, mademoiselle—unless mademoiselle
	would come with me to Paimpol.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne laughed. What should she do in Paimpol?
	There wasn’t even a fisherman left there to fall in
	love with.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle,” said Toinette later, “do you
	think you will meet the little English soldier, Monsieur
	Trevor, in Paris?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans la guerre on ne se revoit jamais</em>,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>But there was more of personal decision than of
	fatalism in her tone.</p>

	<p>So Jeanne waited for a day or two until the regiment
	marched away, and then, with heavy heart, set
	out for Paris. She wrote, indeed, to Phineas, and
	weeks afterwards Phineas, who was in the thick of
	the Somme fighting, wrote to Doggie telling him of
	her departure from Frélus; but regretted that as he
	had lost her letter he could not give him her Paris
	address.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page328" title="328"> </a>And in the meantime the house of Gaspard Morin
	was shuttered and locked and sealed; and the bureaucratically
	minded old Postmaster of Frélus, who had
	received no instructions from Jeanne to forward her
	correspondence, handed Doggie’s letters and telegrams
	to the aged postman, a superannuated herdsman, who
	stuck them into the letter-box of the deserted house
	and went away conscious of duty perfectly accomplished.</p>

	<p>Then, at last, Doggie, fit again for active service,
	went out with a draft to France, and joined Phineas
	and Mo, almost the only survivors of the cheery,
	familiar crowd that he had loved, and the grimness
	of battles such as he had never conceived possible took
	him in its inexorable grip, and he lost sense of everything
	save that he was the least important thing on
	God’s earth struggling desperately for animal existence.</p>

	<p>Yet there were rare times of relief from stress,
	when he could gropingly string together the facts of
	a pre-Somme existence. And then he would curse
	Phineas lustily for losing the precious letter.</p>

	<p>“Man,” Phineas once replied, “don’t you see that
	you’re breaking a heart which, in spite of its apparent
	rugosity and callosity, is as tender as a new-made
	mother’s? Tell me to do it, and I’ll desert and make
	my way to Paris and——”</p>

	<p>“And the military police will see that you make
	your way to hell via a stone wall. And serve you
	right. Don’t be a blithering fool,” said Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Then I don’t know what I can do for you,
	laddie, except die of remorse at your feet.”</p>

	<p>“We’re all going to die of rheumatic fever,” said
	Doggie, shivering in his sodden uniform. “Blast this
	rain!”</p>

	<p>Phineas thrust his hand beneath his clothing and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page329" title="329"> </a>produced a long, amorphous and repulsive substance,
	like a painted tallow candle overcome by intense heat,
	from which he gravely bit an inch or two.</p>

	<p>“What’s that?” asked Doggie.</p>

	<p>“It’s a stick of peppermint,” said Phineas. “I’ve
	still an aunt in Galashiels who remembers my
	existence.”</p>

	<p>Doggie stuck out his hand like a monkey in the
	Zoo.</p>

	<p>“You selfish beast!” he said.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XXIII"><a class="pagenum" id="page330" title="330"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> fighting went on and, to Doggie, the inhabitants
	of the outside world became almost
	as phantasmagorical as Phineas’s providential aunt in
	Galashiels. Immediate existence held him. In an
	historic battle Mo Shendish fell with a machine bullet
	through his heart. Doggie, staggering with the rest
	of the company to the attack over the muddy, shell-torn
	ground, saw him go down a few yards away. It
	was not till later that he knew he had gone West
	with many other great souls. Doggie and Phineas
	mourned for him as a brother. Without him France
	was a muddier and a bloodier place and the outside
	world more unreal than ever.</p>

	<p>Then to Doggie came a heart-broken letter from the
	Dean. Oliver had gone the same road as Mo. Peggy
	was frantic with grief. Vividly Doggie saw the peaceful
	deanery on which all the calamity of all the war had
	crashed with sudden violence.</p>

	<p>“Why I should thank God we parted as friends,
	I don’t quite know,” said Doggie, “but I do.”</p>

	<p>“I suppose, laddie,” said Phineas, “it’s good to feel
	that smiling eyes and hearty hands will greet us when
	we too pass over the Border. My God, man,” he added
	reflectively, after a pause, “have you ever considered
	what a goodly company it will be?  When you come to
	look at it that way, it makes Death quite a trivial affair.”</p>

	<p>“I suppose it does to us while we’re here,” said Doggie.
	“We’ve seen such a lot of it. But to those who
	<a class="pagenum" id="page331" title="331"> </a>haven’t—my poor Peggy—it’s the end of her universe.”</p>

	<p>Yes, it was all very well to take death philosophically,
	or fatalistically, or callously, or whatever you liked to
	call it, out there, where such an attitude was the only
	stand against raving madness; but at home, beneath
	the grey mass of the cathedral, folks met Death as a
	strange and cruel horror. The new glory of life that
	Peggy had found, he had blackened out in an instant.
	Doggie looked again at the old man’s letter—his handwriting
	was growing shaky—and forgot for a while
	the familiar things around him, and lived with Peggy
	in her sorrow.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Then, as far as Doggie’s sorely tried division was
	affected, came the end of the great autumn fighting.
	He found himself well behind the lines in reserve,
	and so continued during the cold dreary winter months.
	And the more the weeks that crept by and the more
	remote seemed Jeanne, the more Doggie hungered
	for the sight of her. But all this period of his life
	was but a dun-coloured monotony, with but few
	happenings to distinguish week from week. Most
	of the company that had marched with him into
	Frélus were dead or wounded. Nearly all the officers
	had gone. Captain Willoughby, who had interrogated
	Jeanne with regard to the restored packet, and, on
	Doggie’s return, had informed him with a friendly
	smile that they were a damned sight too busy then to
	worry about defaulters of the likes of him, but that
	he was going to be court-martialled and shot as soon
	as peace was declared, when they would have time
	to think of serious matters—Captain Willoughby had
	gone to Blighty with a leg so mauled that never would
	he command again a company in the field. Sergeant
	Ballinghall, who had taught Doggie to use his fists,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page332" title="332"> </a>had retired, minus a hand, into civil life. A scientific
	and sporting helper at Roehampton, he informed
	Doggie by letter, was busily engaged on the invention
	of a boxing-glove which would enable him to carry
	on his pugilistic career. “So, in future times,” said
	he, “if any of your friends among the nobility and
	gentry want lessons in the noble art, don’t forget
	your old friend Ballinghall.” Whereat—incidentally—Doggie
	wondered. Never, for a fraction of a second,
	during their common military association, had Ballinghall
	given him to understand that he regarded him
	otherwise than as a mere Tommy without any pretensions
	to gentility. There had been times when
	Ballinghall had cursed him—perhaps justifiably and
	perhaps lovingly—as though he had been the scum of
	the earth. Doggie would no more have dared address
	him in terms of familiarity than he would have dared
	slap the Brigadier-General on the back. And now
	the honest warrior sought Doggie’s patronage. Of
	the original crowd in England who had transformed
	Doggie’s military existence by making him penny-whistler
	to the company, only Phineas and himself
	were left. There were others, of course, good and
	gallant fellows, with whom he became bound in the
	rough intimacy of the army; but the first friends,
	those under whose protecting kindliness his manhood
	had developed, were the dearest. And their ghosts
	remained dear.</p>

	<p>At last the division was moved up and there was
	more fighting.</p>

	<p>One day, after a successful raid, Doggie tumbled
	back with the rest of the men into the trench and,
	looking about, missed Phineas. Presently the word
	went round that “Mac” had been hit, and later the
	rumour was confirmed by the passage down the trench
	<a class="pagenum" id="page333" title="333"> </a>of Phineas on a stretcher, his weather-battered face
	a ghastly ivory.</p>

	<p>“I’m alive all right, laddie,” he gasped, contorting
	his lips into a smile. “I’ve got it clean through the
	chest like a gentleman. But it gars me greet I canna
	look after you any longer.”</p>

	<p>He made an attempt at waving a hand, and the
	stretcher-bearers carried him away out of the army for
	ever.</p>

	<p>Thereafter Doggie felt the loneliest thing on earth,
	like Wordsworth’s cloud, or the Last Man in
	Tom Hood’s grim poem. For was he not the last
	man of the original company, as he had joined it,
	hundreds of years ago, in England? It was only
	then that he realized fully the merits of the wastrel
	Phineas McPhail. Not once or twice, but a thousand
	times had the man’s vigilant affection, veiled under
	cynical humour, saved him from despair. Not once
	but a thousand times had the gaunt, tireless Scotchman
	saved him from physical exhaustion. At every turn
	of his career, since his enlistment, Phineas had been
	there, watchful, helpful, devoted. There he had
	been, always ready and willing to be cursed. To
	curse him had been the great comfort of Doggie’s
	life. Whom could he curse now? Not a soul—no
	one, at any rate, against whom he could launch
	an anathema with any real heart in it. Than curse
	vainly and superficially, far better not to curse at all.
	He missed Phineas beyond all his conception of the
	blankness of bereavement. Like himself, Phineas had
	found salvation in the army. Doggie realized how
	he had striven in his own queer way to redeem the
	villainy of his tutorship. No woman could have been
	more gentle, more unselfish.</p>

	<p>“What the devil am I going to do?” said Doggie.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page334" title="334"> </a>Meanwhile Phineas, lying in a London hospital
	with a bullet through his body, thought much and
	earnestly of his friend, and one morning Peggy got a
	letter.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“Dear Madam,—</p>

		<p>“Time was when I could not have addressed
		you without incurring your not unjustifiable disapproval.
		But I take the liberty of doing so now,
		trusting to your generous acquiescence in the proposition
		that the war has purged many offences. If this
		has not happened, to some extent, in my case, I do
		not see how it has been possible for me to have regained
		and retained the trust and friendship of so sensitive
		and honourable a gentleman as Mr. Marmaduke
		Trevor.</p>

		<p>“If I ask you to come and see me here, where I
		am lying severely wounded, it is not with an intention
		to solicit a favour for myself personally—although I’ll
		not deny that the sight of a kind and familiar face
		would be a boon to a lonely and friendless man—but
		with a deep desire to advance Mr. Trevor’s happiness.
		Lest you may imagine I am committing an unpardonable
		impertinence and thereby totally misunderstand
		me, I may say that this happiness can only be achieved
		by the aid of powerful friends both in London and
		Paris.</p>

		<p>“It is only because the lad is the one thing dear
		to me left in the world, that I venture to intrude on
		your privacy at such a time.</p>

		<p class="signature">“I am, dear Madam,<br />
		“Yours very faithfully,<br />
		“<span class="name">Phineas McPhail.</span>”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Peggy came down to breakfast, and having dutifully
	<a class="pagenum" id="page335" title="335"> </a>kissed her parents, announced her intention of going
	to London by the eleven o’clock train.</p>

	<p>“Why, how can you, my dear?” asked Mrs.
	Conover.</p>

	<p>“I’ve nothing particular to do here for the next
	few days.”</p>

	<p>“But your father and I have. Neither of us can
	start off to London at a moment’s notice.”</p>

	<p>Peggy replied with a wan smile: “But, dearest
	mother, you forget. I’m an old, old married woman.”</p>

	<p>“Besides, my dear,” said the Dean, “Peggy has
	often gone away by herself.”</p>

	<p>“But never to London,” said Mrs. Conover.</p>

	<p>“Anyhow, I’ve got to go.” Peggy turned to the
	old butler. “Ring up Sturrocks’s and tell them I’m
	coming.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, miss,” said Burford.</p>

	<p>“He’s as bad as you are, mother,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>So she went up to London and stayed the night
	at Sturrocks’s alone, for the first time in her life.
	She half ate a lonely, execrable war dinner in the stuffy,
	old-fashioned dining-room, served ceremoniously by
	the ancient head waiter, the friend of her childhood,
	who, in view of her recent widowhood, addressed her
	in the muffled tones of the sympathetic undertaker.
	Peggy nearly cried. She wished she had chosen another
	hotel. But where else could she have gone?
	She had stayed at few hotels in London: once at
	the Savoy; once at Claridge’s; every other time at
	Sturrocks’s. The Savoy? Its vastness had frightened
	her. And Claridge’s? No; that was sanctified
	for ever. Oliver in his lordly way had snapped his
	fingers at Sturrocks’s. Only the best was good enough
	for Peggy. Now only Sturrocks’s remained.</p>

	<p>She sought her room immediately after the dreary
	<a class="pagenum" id="page336" title="336"> </a>meal and sat before the fire—it was a damp, chill
	February night—and thought miserable and aching
	thoughts. It happened to be the same room which
	she had occupied, oh—thousands of years ago—on
	the night when Doggie, point-device in new Savile
	Row uniform, had taken her to dinner at the Carlton.
	And she had sat, in the same imitation Charles the
	Second brocaded chair, looking into the same generous,
	old-fashioned fire, thinking—thinking. And she remembered
	clenching her fist and apostrophizing the
	fire and crying out aloud: “Oh, my God! if only
	he makes good!”</p>

	<p>Oceans of years lay between then and now. Doggie
	had made good; every man who came home wounded
	must have made good. Poor old Doggie. But how
	in the name of all that was meant by the word Love
	she could ever have contemplated—as she had contemplated,
	with an obstinate, virginal loyalty—marriage
	with Doggie, she could not understand.</p>

	<p>She undressed, brought the straight-backed chair
	close to the fire, and, in her dainty nightgown, part
	of her trousseau, sat elbow on knee, face in thin,
	clutching hands, slippered feet on fender, thinking,
	thinking once again. Thinking now of the gates of
	Paradise that had opened to her for a few brief weeks.
	Of the man who never had to make good, being the
	wonder of wonders of men, the delicious companion,
	the incomparable lover, the all-compelling revealer,
	the great, gay, scarcely, to her woman’s limited power
	of vision, comprehended heroic soldier. Of the terrifying
	meaninglessness of life, now that her God of
	Very God, in human form, had been swept, in an
	instant, off the earth into the Unknown.</p>

	<p>Yet was life meaningless after all? There must be
	some significance, some inner truth veiled in mystery,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page337" title="337"> </a>behind even the casually accepted and never probed
	religion to which she had been born and in which
	she had found poor refuge. For, like many of her
	thoughtless, unquestioning class, she had looked at
	Christ through stained-glass windows, and now the
	windows were darkened…. For the first time in
	her life, her soul groped intensely towards eternal
	verities. The fire burned low and she shivered. She
	became again the bit of human flotsam cruelly buffeted
	by the waves, forgotten of God. Yet, after she had
	risen and crept into bed and while she was staring
	into the darkness, her heart became filled with a vast
	pity for the thousands and thousands of women, her
	sisters, who at that moment were staring, hopeless,
	like her, into the unrelenting night.</p>

	<p>She did not fall asleep till early morning. She
	rose late. About half-past eleven as she was preparing
	to walk abroad on a dreary shopping excursion—the
	hospital visiting hour was in the afternoon—a telegram
	arrived from the Dean.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Just heard that Marmaduke is severely wounded.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">She scarcely recognized the young private tutor
	of Denby Hall in the elderly man with the deeply
	furrowed face, who smiled as she approached his bed.
	She had brought him flowers, cigarettes of the exquisite
	kind that Doggie used to smoke, chocolates….</p>

	<p>She sat down by his bedside.</p>

	<p>“All this is more than gracious, Mrs. Manningtree,”
	said Phineas. “To a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux routier</em> like me,
	it is a wee bit overwhelming.”</p>

	<p>“It’s very little to do for Doggie’s best friend.”</p>

	<p>Phineas’s eyes twinkled. “If you call him Doggie,
	like that, maybe it won’t be so difficult for me to
	talk to you.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page338" title="338"> </a>“Why should it be difficult at all?” she asked.
	“We both love him.”</p>

	<p>“Ay,” said Phineas. “He’s a lovable lad, and it is
	because others besides you and me find him lovable,
	that I took the liberty of writing to you.”</p>

	<p>“The girl in France?”</p>

	<p>“Eh?” He put out a bony hand, and regarded
	her in some disappointment. “Has he told you?
	Perhaps you know all about it.”</p>

	<p>“I know nothing except that—‘a girl in France,’
	was all he told me. But—first about yourself. How
	badly are you wounded—and what can we do for
	you?”</p>

	<p>She dragged from a reluctant Phineas the history
	of his wound and obtained confirmation of his statement
	from a nurse who happened to pass up the gangway
	of the pleasant ward and lingered by the bedside.
	McPhail was doing splendidly. Of course, a man
	with a hole through his body must be expected to go
	back to the regime of babyhood. So long as he behaved
	himself like a well-conducted baby all would
	be well. Peggy drew the nurse a few yards away.</p>

	<p>“I’ve just heard that his dearest friend out there,
	a boy whom he loves dearly and has been through
	the whole thing with him in the same company—it’s
	odd, but he was his private tutor years ago—both
	gentlemen, you know—in fact, I’m here just to talk
	about the boy——” Peggy grew somewhat incoherent.
	“Well—I’ve just heard that the boy has
	been seriously wounded. Shall I tell him?”</p>

	<p>“I think it would be better to wait for a few days.
	Any shock like that sends up their temperatures.
	We hate temperatures, and we’re getting his down
	so nicely.”</p>

	<p>“All right,” said Peggy, and she went back smiling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page339" title="339"> </a>to Phineas. “She says you’re getting on amazingly,
	Mr. McPhail.”</p>

	<p>Said Phineas: “I’m grateful to you, Mrs. Manningtree,
	for concerning yourself about my entirely
	unimportant carcass. Now, as Virgil says, ‘<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">paullo
	majora canemus</em>.’”</p>

	<p>“You have me there, Mr. McPhail,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Let us sing of somewhat greater things. That
	is the bald translation. Let us talk of Doggie—if
	so be it is agreeable to you.”</p>

	<p>“Carry on,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Well,” said Phineas, “to begin at the beginning,
	we marched into a place called Frélus——”</p>

	<p>In his pedantic way he began to tell her the story
	of Jeanne, so far as he knew it. He told her of the
	girl standing in the night wind and rain on the bluff
	by the turning of the road. He told her of Doggie’s
	insane adventure across No Man’s Land to the farm
	of La Folette. Tears rolled down Peggy’s cheeks.
	She cried, incredulous:</p>

	<p>“Doggie did that? Doggie?”</p>

	<p>“It was child’s play to what he had to do at Guedecourt.”</p>

	<p>But Peggy waved away the vague heroism of Guedecourt.</p>

	<p>“Doggie did that? For a woman?”</p>

	<p>The whole elaborate structure of her conception of
	Doggie tumbled down like a house of cards.</p>

	<p>“Ay,” said Phineas.</p>

	<p>“He did that”—Phineas had given an imaginative
	and picturesque account of the episode—“for
	this girl Jeanne?”</p>

	<p>“It is a strange coincidence, Mrs. Manningtree,”
	replied Phineas, with a flicker of his lips elusively
	suggestive of unctuousness, “that almost those identical
	<a class="pagenum" id="page340" title="340"> </a>words were used by Mademoiselle Bossière in my
	presence. ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a fait cela pour moi!</em>’ But—you will
	pardon me for saying it—with a difference of intonation,
	which, as a woman, no doubt you will be able
	to divine and appreciate.”</p>

	<p>“I know,” said Peggy. She bent forward and
	picked with finger and thumb at the fluff of the
	blanket. Then she said, intent on the fluff: “If a
	man had done a thing like that for me, I should have
	crawled after him to the ends of the earth.” Presently
	she looked up with a flash of the eyes. “Why isn’t
	this girl doing it?”</p>

	<p>“You must listen to the end of the story,” said
	Phineas. “I may tell you that I always regarded
	myself, with my Scots caution, as a model of tact and
	discretion; but after many conversations with Doggie,
	I’m beginning to have my doubts. I also imagined
	that I was very careful of my personal belongings;
	but facts have convicted me of criminal laxity.”</p>

	<p>Peggy smiled. “That sounds like a confession,
	Mr. McPhail.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe it’s in the nature of one,” he assented.
	“But by your leave, Mrs. Manningtree, I’ll resume
	my narrative.”</p>

	<p>He continued the story of Jeanne: how she had
	learned through him of Doggie’s wealth and position
	and early upbringing; of the memorable dinner-party
	with poor Mo; of Doggie’s sensitive interpretation
	of her French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoise</em> attitude; and finally the loss
	of the letter containing her address in Paris.</p>

	<p>After he had finished, Peggy sat for a long while
	thinking. This romance in Doggie’s life had moved
	her as she thought she could never be moved since
	the death of Oliver. Her thoughts winged themselves
	back to an afternoon, remote almost as her socked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page341" title="341"> </a>and sashed childhood, when Doggie, immaculately
	attired in grey and pearl harmonies, had declared,
	with his little effeminate drawl, that tennis made one
	so terribly hot. The scene in the Deanery garden
	flashed before her. It was succeeded by a scene in
	the Deanery drawing-room when, to herself indignant,
	he had pleaded his delicacy of constitution. And the
	same Doggie, besides braving death a thousand times
	in the ordinary execution of his soldier’s duties, had
	performed this queer deed of heroism for a girl. Then
	his return to Durdlebury——</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid,” she said suddenly, “I was dreadfully
	unkind to him when he came home the last time. I
	didn’t understand. Did he tell you?”</p>

	<p>Phineas stretched out a hand and with the tips of
	his fingers touched her sleeve.</p>

	<p>“Mrs. Manningtree,” he said softly, “don’t you
	know that Doggie’s a very wonderful gentleman?”</p>

	<p>Again her eyes grew moist. “Yes. I know. Of
	course he never would have mentioned it…. I
	thought, Mr. McPhail, he had deteriorated—God
	forgive me! I thought he had coarsened and got into
	the ways of an ordinary Tommy—and I was snobbish
	and uncomprehending and horrible. It seems as if
	I am making a confession now.”</p>

	<p>“Ay. Why not? If it were not for the soul’s
	health, the ancient Church wouldn’t have instituted
	the practice.”</p>

	<p>She regarded him shrewdly for a second. “You’ve
	changed too.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe,” said Phineas. “It’s an ill war that
	blows nobody good. And I’m not complaining of
	this one. But you were talking of your miscomprehension
	of Doggie.”</p>

	<p>“I behaved very badly to him,” she said, picking
	<a class="pagenum" id="page342" title="342"> </a>again at the blanket. “I misjudged him altogether—because
	I was ignorant of everything—everything
	that matters in life. But I’ve learned better since then.”</p>

	<p>“Ay,” remarked Phineas gravely.</p>

	<p>“Mr. McPhail,” she said, after a pause, “it wasn’t
	those rotten ideas that prevented me from marrying
	him——”</p>

	<p>“I know, my dear little lady,” said Phineas, grasping
	the plucking hand. “You just loved the other man
	as you never could have loved Doggie, and there’s
	an end to’t. Love just happens. It’s the holiest
	thing in the world.”</p>

	<p>She turned her hand, so as to meet his in a mutual
	clasp, and withdrew it.</p>

	<p>“You’re very kind—and sympathetic—and understanding——”
	Her voice broke. “I seem to have
	been going about misjudging everybody and everything.
	I’m beginning to see a little bit—a little bit farther—I
	can’t express myself——”</p>

	<p>“Never mind, Mrs. Manningtree,” said Phineas
	soothingly, “if you cannot express yourself in
	words. Leave that to the politicians and the philosophers
	and the theologians, and other such windy
	expositors of the useless. But you can express yourself
	in deeds.”</p>

	<p>“How?”</p>

	<p>“Find Jeanne for Doggie.”</p>

	<p>Peggy bent forward with a queer light in her eyes.</p>

	<p>“Does she love him—really love him as he deserves
	to be loved?”</p>

	<p>“It is not often, Mrs. Manningtree, that I commit
	myself to a definite statement. But, to my certain
	knowledge, these two are breaking their hearts for
	each other. Couldn’t you find her, before the poor
	laddie is killed?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page343" title="343"> </a>“He’s not killed yet, thank God!” said Peggy,
	with an odd thrill in her voice.</p>

	<p>He was alive. Only severely wounded. He would
	be coming home soon, carried, according to convoy,
	to any unfriendly hospital dumping-ground in the
	United Kingdom. If only she could bring this French
	girl to him! She yearned to make reparation for
	the past, to act according to the new knowledge that
	love and sorrow had brought her.</p>

	<p>“But how can I find her—just a girl—an unknown
	Mademoiselle Bossière—among the millions
	of Paris?”</p>

	<p>“I’ve been racking my brains all the morning,”
	replied Phineas, “to recall the address, and out of
	the darkness there emerges just two words, <em>Port Royal</em>.
	If you know Paris, does that help you at all?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know Paris,” replied Peggy humbly. “I
	don’t know anything. I’m utterly ignorant.”</p>

	<p>“I beg entirely to differ from you, Mrs. Manningtree,”
	said Phineas. “You have come through much
	heavy travail to a correct appreciation of the meaning
	of human love between man and woman, and so
	you have in you the wisdom of all the ages.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, yes,” said Peggy, becoming practical. “But
	<em>Port Royal</em>?”</p>

	<p>“The clue to the labyrinth,” replied Phineas.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter_XXIV"><a class="pagenum" id="page344" title="344"> </a>
	<h2 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> Dean of an English cathedral is a personage.</p>

	<p>He has power. He can stand with folded
	arms at its door and forbid entrance to anyone, save,
	perhaps, the King in person. He can tell not only
	the Bishop of the Diocese, but the very Archbishop
	of the Province, to run away and play. Having power
	and using it benignly and graciously, he can exert its
	subtler form known as influence. In the course of
	his distinguished career he is bound to make many
	queer friends in high places.</p>

	<p>“My dear Field-Marshal, could you do me a little
	favour…?”</p>

	<p>“My dear Ambassador, my daughter, etc., etc….”</p>

	<p>Deans, discreet, dignified gentlemen, who would
	not demand the impossible, can generally get what
	they ask for.</p>

	<p>When Peggy returned to Durdlebury and put
	Doggie’s case before her father, and with unusual
	fervour roused him from his first stupefaction at the
	idea of her mad project, he said mildly:</p>

	<p>“Let me understand clearly what you want to do.
	You want to go to Paris by yourself, discover a girl
	called Jeanne Bossière, concerning whose address you
	know nothing but two words—Port Royal—of course
	there is a Boulevard Port Royal somewhere south of
	the Luxembourg Gardens——”</p>

	<p>“Then we’ve found her,” cried Peggy. “We
	only want the number.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page345" title="345"> </a>“Please don’t interrupt,” said the Dean. “You
	confuse me, my dear. You want to find this girl
	and re-establish communication between her and
	Marmaduke, and—er—generally play Fairy Godmother.”</p>

	<p>“If you like to put it that way,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Are you quite certain you would be acting wisely?
	From Marmaduke’s point of view——”</p>

	<p>“Don’t call him Marmaduke”—she bent forward
	and touched his knee caressingly—“Marmaduke could
	never have risked his life for a woman. It was Doggie
	who did it. She thinks of him as Doggie. Every one
	thinks of him now and loves him as Doggie. It was
	Oliver’s name for him, don’t you see? And he has
	stuck it out and made it a sort of title of honour and
	affection—and it was as Doggie that Oliver learned
	to love him, and in his last letter to Oliver he signed
	himself ‘Your devoted Doggie.’”</p>

	<p>“My dear,” smiled the Dean, and quoted:
	“‘What’s in a name? A rose——’”</p>

	<p>“Would be unendurable if it were called a bug-squash.
	The poetry would be knocked out of it.”</p>

	<p>The Dean said indulgently: “So the name Doggie
	connotes something poetic and romantic?”</p>

	<p>“You ask the girl Jeanne.”</p>

	<p>The Dean tapped the back of his daughter’s hand
	that rested on his knee.</p>

	<p>“There’s no fool like an old fool, my dear. Do you
	know why?”</p>

	<p>She shook her head.</p>

	<p>“Because the old fool has learned to understand
	the young fool, whereas the young fool doesn’t understand
	anybody.”</p>

	<p>She laughed and threw herself on her knees by
	his side.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page346" title="346"> </a>“Daddy, you’re immense!”</p>

	<p>He took the tribute complacently. “What was I
	saying before you interrupted me? Oh yes. About
	the wisdom of your proposed action. Are you sure
	they want each other?”</p>

	<p>“As sure as I’m sitting here,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Then, my dear,” said he, “I’ll do what I can.”</p>

	<p>Whether he wrote to Field-Marshals and Ambassadors
	or to lesser luminaries, Peggy did not know.
	The Dean observed an old-world punctilio about such
	matters. At the first reply or two to his letters he
	frowned; at the second or two he smiled in the way
	any elderly gentleman may smile when he finds himself
	recognized by high-and-mightiness as a person of
	importance.</p>

	<p>“I think, my dear,” said he at last, “I’ve arranged
	everything for you.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">So it came to pass that while Doggie, with a shattered
	shoulder and a touched left lung, was being transported
	from a base hospital in France to a hospital in England,
	Peggy, armed with all kinds of passports and recommendations,
	and a very fixed, personal sanctified idea,
	was crossing the Channel on her way to Paris and
	Jeanne.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">And, after all, it was no wild-goose chase, but a
	very simple matter. An urbane, elderly person at the
	British Embassy performed certain telephonic gymnastics.
	At the end:</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, merci. Adieu!</em>”</p>

	<p>He turned to her.</p>

	<p>“A representative from the Prefecture of Police
	will wait on you at your hotel at ten o’clock to-morrow
	morning.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page347" title="347"> </a>The official called, took notes, and confidently
	assured her that he would obtain the address of Mademoiselle
	Jeanne Bossière within twelve hours.</p>

	<p>“But how, monsieur, are you going to do it?”
	asked Peggy.</p>

	<p>“Madame,” said he, “in spite of the war, the telegraphic,
	telephonic, and municipal systems of France
	work in perfect order—to say nothing of that of the
	police. Frélus, I think, is the name of the place she
	started from?”</p>

	<p>At eight o’clock in the evening, after her lonely
	dinner in the great hotel, the polite official called again.
	She met him in the lounge.</p>

	<p>“Madame,” said he, “I have the pleasure to inform
	you that Mademoiselle Jeanne Bossière, late of Frélus,
	is living in Paris at 743<sup>bis</sup> Boulevard Port Royal, and
	spends all her days at the succursale of the French
	Red Cross in the Rue Vaugirard.”</p>

	<p>“Have you seen her and told her?”</p>

	<p>“No, madame, that did not come within my
	instructions.”</p>

	<p>“I am infinitely grateful to you,” said Peggy.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il n’y a pas de quoi</em>, madame. I perform the tasks
	assigned to me and am only too happy, in this case,
	to have been successful.”</p>

	<p>“But, monsieur,” said Peggy, feeling desperately
	lonely in Paris, and pathetically eager to talk to a
	human being, even in her rusty Vévey school French,
	“haven’t you wondered why I’ve been so anxious to
	find this young lady?”</p>

	<p>“If we began to wonder,” he replied with a
	laugh, “at the things which happen during the war,
	we should be so bewildered that we shouldn’t be
	able to carry on our work. Madame,” said he,
	handing her his card, “if you should have further
	<a class="pagenum" id="page348" title="348"> </a>need of me in the matter, I am always at your
	service.”</p>

	<p>He bowed profoundly and left her.</p>

	<p>Peggy stayed at the Ritz because, long ago, when
	her parents had fetched her from Vévey and had given
	her the one wonderful fortnight in Paris she had ever
	known, they had chosen this dignified and not inexpensive
	hostelry. To her girlish mind it had
	breathed the last word of splendour, movement, gaiety—all
	that was connoted by the magical name of the
	City of Light. But now the glamour had departed.
	She wondered whether it had ever been. Oliver had
	laughed at her experiences. Sandwiched between dear
	old Uncle Edward and Aunt Sophia, what in the
	sacred name of France could she have seen of Paris?
	Wait till they could turn round. He would take her
	to Paris. She would have the unimagined time of
	her life. They dreamed dreams of the Rue de la
	Paix—he had five hundred pounds laid by, which he
	had ear-marked for an orgy of shopping in that Temptation
	Avenue of a thoroughfare; of Montmartre, the
	citadel of delectable wickedness and laughter; of
	funny little restaurants in dark streets where you are
	delighted to pay twenty francs for a mussel, so exquisitely
	is it cooked; of dainty and crazy theatres;
	of long drives, folded in each other’s arms, when
	moonlight touches dawn, through the wonders of the
	enchanted city.</p>

	<p>Her brief dreams had eclipsed her girlish memories.
	Now the dreams had become blurred. She strove to
	bring them back till her soul ached, till she broke down
	into miserable weeping. She was alone in a strange,
	unedifying town; in a strange, vast, commonplace
	hotel. The cold, moonlit Place de la Vendôme, with
	its memorable column, just opposite her bedroom
	<a class="pagenum" id="page349" title="349"> </a>window, meant nothing to her. She had the desolating
	sense that nothing in the world would ever matter to
	her again—nothing as far as she, Peggy Manningtree,
	was concerned. Her life was over. Altruism alone
	gave sanction to continued existence. Hence her
	present adventure. Paris might have been Burslem
	for all the interest it afforded.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Jeanne worked from morning to night in the succursale
	of the Croix Rouge in the Rue Vaugirard.
	She had tried, after the establishment of her affairs,
	to enter, in no matter what capacity, a British base
	hospital. It would be a consolation for her surrender
	of Doggie to work for his wounded comrades. Besides,
	twice in her life she owed everything to the
	English, and the repayment of the debt was a matter
	of conscience. But she found that the gates of English
	hospitals were thronged with English girls; and she
	could not even speak the language. So, guided by
	the Paris friend with whom she lodged, she made her
	way to the Rue Vaugirard, where, in the packing-room,
	she had found hard unemotional employment.
	Yet the work had to be done: and it was done for
	France, which, after all, was dearer to her than England;
	and among her fellow-workers, women of all
	classes, she had pleasant companionship.</p>

	<p>When, one day, the old concierge, bemedalled from
	the war of 1870, appeared to her in the packing-room,
	with the announcement that a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dame anglaise</em> desired
	to speak to her, she was at first bewildered. She
	knew no English ladies—had never met one in her
	life. It took a second or two for the thought to flash
	that the visit might concern Doggie. Then came
	conviction. In blue overall and cap, she followed the
	concierge to the ante-room, her heart beating. At
	<a class="pagenum" id="page350" title="350"> </a>the sight of the young Englishwoman in black, with
	a crape hat and little white band beneath the veil, it
	nearly stopped altogether.</p>

	<p>Peggy advanced with outstretched hand.</p>

	<p>“You are Mademoiselle Jeanne Bossière?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

	<p>“I am a cousin of Monsieur Trevor——”</p>

	<p>“Ah, madame”—Jeanne pointed to the mourning—“you
	do not come to tell me he is dead?”</p>

	<p>Peggy smiled. “No. I hope not.”</p>

	<p>“Ah!” Jeanne sighed in relief, “I thought——”</p>

	<p>“This is for my husband,” said Peggy quietly.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, madame! je demande bien pardon. J’ai dû
	vous faire de la peine. Je n’y pensais pas</em>——”</p>

	<p>Jeanne was in great distress. Peggy smiled again.
	“Widows dress differently in England and France.”
	She looked around and her eyes fell upon a bench by
	the wall. “Could we sit down and have a little
	talk?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pardon, madame, c’est que je suis un peu émue</em> …”
	said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>She led the way to the bench. They sat down
	together, and for a feminine second or two took stock
	of each other. Jeanne’s first rebellious instinct said:
	“I was right.” In her furs and her perfect millinery
	and perfect shoes and perfect black silk stockings that
	appeared below the short skirt, Peggy, blue-eyed, fine-featured,
	the fine product of many generations of
	scholarly English gentlefolk, seemed to incarnate her
	vague conjectures of the social atmosphere in which
	Doggie had his being. Her peasant blood impelled
	her to suspicion, to a half-grudging admiration, to self-protective
	jealousy. The Englishwoman’s ease of
	manner, in spite of her helter-skelter French, oppressed
	her with an angry sense of inferiority. She was also
	<a class="pagenum" id="page351" title="351"> </a>conscious of the blue overall and close-fitting cap.
	Yet the Englishwoman’s smile was kind and she had
	lost her husband…. And Peggy, looking at this
	girl with the dark, tragic eyes and refined, pale face
	and graceful gestures, in the funny instinctive British
	way tried to place her socially. Was she a lady?
	It made such a difference. This was the girl for whom
	Doggie had performed his deed of knight-errantry;
	the girl whom she proposed to take back to Doggie.
	For the moment, discounting the uniform which might
	have hidden a midinette or a duchess, she had nothing
	but the face and the gestures and the beautifully
	modulated voice to go upon, and between the accent
	of the midinette and the duchess—both being equally
	charming to her English ear—Peggy could not discriminate.
	She had, however, beautiful, capable hands,
	and took care of her finger-nails.</p>

	<p>Jeanne broke the tiny spell of embarrassed silence.</p>

	<p>“I am at your disposal, madame.”</p>

	<p>Peggy plunged at once into facts.</p>

	<p>“It may seem strange, my coming to you; but
	the fact is that my cousin, Monsieur Trevor, is severely
	wounded….”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em>” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>“And his friend, Mr. McPhail, who is also
	wounded, thinks that if you—well——”</p>

	<p>Her French failed her—to carry off a very delicate
	situation one must have command of language—she
	could only blurt out—“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut comprendre, mademoiselle.
	Il a fait beaucoup pour vous.</em>”</p>

	<p>She met Jeanne’s dark eyes. Jeanne said:</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, madame, vous avez raison. Il a beaucoup fait
	pour moi.</em>”</p>

	<p>Peggy flushed at the unconscious correction—“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaucoup
	fait</em>” for “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait beaucoup</em>.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page352" title="352"> </a>“He has done not only much, but everything for
	me, madame,” Jeanne continued. “And you who
	have come from England expressly to tell me that he
	is wounded, what do you wish me to do?”</p>

	<p>“Accompany me back to London. I had a telegram
	this morning to say that he had arrived at a
	hospital there.”</p>

	<p>“Then you have not seen him?”</p>

	<p>“Not yet.”</p>

	<p>“Then how, madame, do you know that he desires
	my presence?”</p>

	<p>Peggy glanced at the girl’s hands clasped on her
	lap, and saw that the knuckles were white.</p>

	<p>“I am sure of it.”</p>

	<p>“He would have written, madame. I only received
	one letter from him, and that was while I still lived
	at Frélus.”</p>

	<p>“He wrote many letters and telegraphed to Frélus,
	and received no answers.”</p>

	<p>“Madame,” cried Jeanne, “I implore you to
	believe what I say: but not one of those letters have
	ever reached me.”</p>

	<p>“Not one?”</p>

	<p>At first Peggy was incredulous. Phineas McPhail
	had told her of Doggie’s despair at the lack of response
	from Frélus; and, after all, Frélus had a properly
	constituted post office in working order, which might
	be expected to forward letters. She had therefore
	come prepared to reproach the girl. But …</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je le jure</em>, madame,” said Jeanne.</p>

	<p>And Peggy believed her.</p>

	<p>“But I wrote to Monsieur McPhail, giving him
	my address in Paris.”</p>

	<p>“He lost the letter before he saw Doggie again”—the
	name slipped out—“and forgot the address.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page353" title="353"> </a>“But how did you find me?”</p>

	<p>“I had a lot of difficulty. The British Embassy—the
	Prefecture of Police——”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em>” cried Jeanne again. “Did you do
	all that for me?”</p>

	<p>“For my cousin.”</p>

	<p>“You called him Doggie. That is how I know
	him and think of him.”</p>

	<p>“All right,” smiled Peggy. “For Doggie then.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne’s brain for a moment or two was in a whirl—Embassies
	and Prefectures of Police!</p>

	<p>“Madame, to do this, you must love him very
	much.”</p>

	<p>“I loved him so much—I hope you will understand
	me—my French I know is terrible—but I loved him
	so much that until he came home wounded we were
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancés</em>.”</p>

	<p>Jeanne drew a short breath. “I felt it, madame.
	An English gentleman of great estate would naturally
	marry an English lady of his own social class. That
	is why, madame, I acted as I have done.”</p>

	<p>Then something of what Jeanne really was became
	obvious to Peggy. Lady or no lady, in the conventional
	British sense, Jeanne appealed to her, in her
	quiet dignity and restraint, as a type of Frenchwoman
	whom she had never met before. She suddenly
	conceived an enormous respect for Jeanne. Also for
	Phineas McPhail, whose eulogistic character sketch
	she had accepted with feminine reservations subconsciously
	derisive.</p>

	<p>“My dear,” she said. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous êtes digne de toute
	dame anglaise!</em>”—which wasn’t an elegant way of
	putting it in the French tongue—-but Jeanne, with
	her odd smile of the lips, showed that she understood
	her meaning; she had served her apprenticeship in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page354" title="354"> </a>the interpretation of Anglo-Gallic. “But I want to
	tell you. Doggie and I were engaged. A family
	matter. Then, when he came home wounded—you
	know how—I found that I loved some one—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aimais
	d’amour</em>, as you say—and he found the same. I
	loved the man whom I married. He loved you. He
	confessed it. We parted more affectionate friends
	than we had ever been. I married. He searched
	for you. My husband has been killed. Doggie,
	although wounded, is alive. That is why I am here.”</p>

	<p>They were sitting in a corner of the ante-room,
	and before them passed a continuous stream of the
	busy life of the war, civilians, officers, badged workers,
	elderly orderlies in pathetic bits of uniform that might
	have dated from 1870, wheeling packages in and
	out, groups talking of the business of the organization,
	here and there a blue-vested young lieutenant
	and a blue-overalled packer, talking—it did not need
	God to know of what. But neither of the two women
	heeded this multitude.</p>

	<p>Jeanne said: “Madame, I am profoundly moved
	by what you have told me. If I show little emotion,
	it is because I have suffered greatly from the war.
	One learns self-restraint, madame, or one goes mad.
	But as you have spoken to me in your noble English
	frankness—I have only to confess that I love Doggie
	with all my heart, with all my soul——” With her two
	clenched hands she smote her breast—and Peggy noted
	it was the first gesture that she had made. “I feel
	the infinite need, madame—you will understand me—to
	care for him, to protect him——”</p>

	<p>Peggy raised a beautifully gloved hand.</p>

	<p>“Protect him?” she interrupted. “Why, hasn’t
	he shown himself to be a hero?”</p>

	<p>Jeanne leant forward and grasped the protesting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page355" title="355"> </a>hand by the wrist; and there was a wonderful light
	behind her eyes and a curious vibration in her voice.</p>

	<p>“It is only <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les petits héros tout faits</em>—the little
	ready-made heroes—ready made by the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</em>—who
	have no need of a woman’s protection. But it is a
	different thing with the great heroes who have made
	themselves without the aid of a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</em>, from little
	dogs of no account (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des petits chiens de rien du tout</em>)
	to what Doggie is at the moment. The woman then
	takes her place. She fixes things for ever. She alone
	can understand.”</p>

	<p>Peggy gasped as at a new Revelation. The terms
	in which this French girl expressed herself were far
	beyond the bounds of her philosophy. The varying
	aspects in which Doggie had presented himself to her,
	in the past few months, had been bewildering. Now
	she saw him, in a fresh light, though as in a glass
	darkly, as reflected by Jeanne. Still, she protested
	again, in order to see more clearly.</p>

	<p>“But what would you protect him from?”</p>

	<p>“From want of faith in himself; from want of
	faith in his destiny, madame. Once he told me he
	had come to France to fight for his soul. It is necessary
	that he should be victorious. It is necessary
	that the woman who loves him should make him
	victorious.”</p>

	<p>Peggy put out her hand and touched Jeanne’s wrist.</p>

	<p>“I’m glad I didn’t marry Doggie, mademoiselle,”
	she said simply. “I couldn’t have done that.” She
	paused. “Well?” she resumed. “Will you now
	come with me to London?”</p>

	<p>A faint smile crept into Jeanne’s eyes.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais oui, madame.</em>”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Doggie lay in the long, pleasant ward of the great
	<a class="pagenum" id="page356" title="356"> </a>London hospital, the upper left side of his body a mass of
	bandaged pain. Neck and shoulder, front and back
	and arm, had been shattered and torn by high explosive
	shell. The top of his lung had been grazed. Only
	the remorseless pressure at the base hospital had justified
	the sending of him, after a week, to England. Youth
	and the splendid constitution which Dr. Murdoch
	had proclaimed in the far-off days of the war’s beginning,
	and the toughening training of the war itself,
	carried him through. No more fighting for Doggie
	this side of the grave. But the grave was as far distant
	as it is from any young man in his twenties who
	avoids abnormal peril.</p>

	<p>Till to-day he had not been allowed to see visitors,
	or to receive letters. They told him that the Dean
	of Durdlebury had called; had brought flowers and
	fruit and had left a card “From your Aunt, Peggy
	and myself.” But to-day he felt wonderfully strong,
	in spite of the unrelenting pain, and the nurse had
	said: “I shouldn’t wonder if you had some visitors
	this afternoon.” Peggy, of course. He followed
	the hands of his wrist-watch until they marked the
	visiting hour. And sure enough, a minute afterwards,
	amid the stream of men and women—chiefly women—of
	all grades and kinds, he caught sight of Peggy’s
	face smiling beneath her widow’s hat. She had a
	great bunch of violets in her bodice.</p>

	<p>“My dear old Doggie!” She bent down and
	kissed him. “Those rotten people wouldn’t let me
	come before.”</p>

	<p>“I know,” said Doggie. He pointed to his shoulder.
	“I’m afraid I’m in a hell of a mess. It’s lovely to see
	you.”</p>

	<p>She unpinned the violets and thrust them towards
	his face.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page357" title="357"> </a>“From home. I’ve brought ’em for you.”</p>

	<p>“My God!” said Doggie, burying his nose in the
	huge bunch. “I never knew violets could smell like
	this.” He laid them down with a sigh. “How’s
	everybody?”</p>

	<p>“Quite fit.”</p>

	<p>There was a span of silence. Then he stretched
	out his hand and she gave him hers and he gripped it
	tight.</p>

	<p>“Poor old Peggy dear!”</p>

	<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” she said bravely. “I know
	you care, dear Doggie. That’s enough. I’ve just got
	to stick it like the rest.” She withdrew her hand after
	a little squeeze. “Bless you. Don’t worry about
	me. I’m contemptibly healthy. But you——?”</p>

	<p>“Getting on splendidly. I say, Peggy, what kind
	of people are the Pullingers who have taken Denby
	Hall?”</p>

	<p>“They’re all right, I believe. He’s something in
	the Government—Controller of Feeding-bottles—I
	don’t know. But, oh, Doggie, what an ass you were
	to sell the place up!”</p>

	<p>“I wasn’t.”</p>

	<p>“You were.”</p>

	<p>Doggie laughed. “If you’ve come here to argue
	with me, I shall cry, and then you’ll be turned out
	neck and crop.”</p>

	<p>Peggy looked at him shrewdly. “You seem to
	be going pretty strong.”</p>

	<p>“Never stronger in my life,” lied Doggie.</p>

	<p>“Would you like to see somebody you are very
	fond of?”</p>

	<p>“Somebody I’m fond of? Uncle Edward?”</p>

	<p>“No, no.” She waved the Very Reverend the
	Dean to the empyrean.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page358" title="358"> </a>“Dear old Phineas? Has he come through? I’ve
	not had time to ask whether you’ve heard anything
	about him.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, he’s flourishing. He wrote to me. I’ve
	seen him.”</p>

	<p>“Praise the Lord!” cried Doggie. “My dear,
	there’s no one on earth, save you, whom I should
	so much love to see as Phineas. If he’s there, fetch
	him along.”</p>

	<p>Peggy nodded and smiled mysteriously and went
	away down the ward. And Doggie thought:
	“Thank God, Peggy has the strength to face the
	world—and thank God Phineas has come through.”
	He closed his eyes, feeling rather tired, thinking of
	Phineas. Of his last words as he passed him stretcher-borne
	in the trench. Of the devotion of the man.
	Of his future. Well, never mind his future. In all
	his vague post-war schemes for reorganization of the
	social system, Phineas had his place. No further need
	for dear old Phineas to stand in light green and gold
	outside a picture palace. He had thought it out long
	ago, although he had never said a word to Phineas.
	Now he could set the poor chap’s mind at rest for
	ever.</p>

	<p>He looked round contentedly, and saw Peggy and
	a companion coming down the ward, together. But
	it was not Phineas. It was a girl in black.</p>

	<p>He raised himself, forgetful of exquisite pain, on
	his right elbow, and stared in a thrill of amazement.</p>

	<p>And Jeanne came to him, and there were no longer
	ghosts behind her eyes, for they shone like stars.</p>
